<h1 class="f3">Introduction</h1>
<p class="f1">Chances are, you’ve heard about using aloe to treat sunburns. And with good reason! Aloe is probably the best treatment on the market right now to cool, soothe and heal sunburns.</p>

<p class="f1">This post answers the question: can aloe vera help to prevent skin cancer? Keep reading to find out more!</p>
<h2 class="f2">Does Aloe Help Prevent Skin Cancer?</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>Aloe contains aloe-emodin, a compound known to slow the growth of cancer cells. However, aloe is not recommended to be used as a sole skin cancer preventative measure. Using sunscreen to prevent sun-damage with aloe is strongly recommended. Also, aloe helps heal sunburns which can help avoid other unpleasant side effects like peeling.</b></p>
<h1 class="f3">What is Skin Cancer?</h1>
<p class="f1">Before we dive into Aloe vera and its role in skin cancer, let’s look at skin cancer as a whole.</p>
<p class="f1">Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of cells that is usually caused by unprotected exposure to the sun’s UV rays. Another cause of skin cancer can be tanning beds. Skin cancer has multiple different types of varying seriousness, but all can be treated to some extent. Now that we understand skin cancer a little better, keep reading to find out if aloe can help to prevent it.</p>

<p class="w3">Warning!</p>
<p class="w1">If you think you have skin cancer be sure to go to a doctor. While not all skin-cancer is extremely serious, it is vital that you get the opinion of your doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 class="f2">So, Can Aloe Really Prevent Skin Cancer?</h2>

<p class="f1">While there isn’t any concrete research that aloe vera can prevent skin cancer before it happens, there is <a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/60/11/2800" target="_blank">new research</a> suggesting that compounds found in the aloe leaf can slow the proliferation—or growth— of cervical cancerous cells. While this new research is very exciting it’s not known if the same effect can be expected on skin cancer cells. For these reasons, it’s fair to say that aloe cannot prevent skin cancer effectively on its own.</p>
<p class="f1">Buf that doesn't mean you can't use aloe along with other things to have a healthy, good-looking skin. In the end, it all comes down to taking care of ourselves and our bodies, and that my frind, will definitely help prevent all sorts of bad things.</p>
