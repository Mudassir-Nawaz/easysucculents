<h2 class="f2">How to use Aloe Oil?</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>Aloe Vera oil has healing properties that have been known to grow hair faster, help to treat hair loss and also help with dark spots, stretch marks and wrinkles! Aloe Vera oil is made by adding the aloe vera juices to a base (like coconut oil or almond oil) thus, creating an oil extract.</b></p>

<h1 class="f3">Top Uses for Aloe Vera Oil</h1>
<p class="f1">The most popular way to use aloe vera oil is in your hair. The vitamins found in aloe vera, when added to coconut oil can help to moisturize your scalp and even help your hair to grow! It's also great for the skin.</p>

<h2 class="f2">1. Hair growth and regrowth</h2>
<p class="f1">What happens when you get a bad haircut at a salon? Or, if you suffer from hair loss? Or maybe your eyebrows are too thin? Usually you’ll just have to wait the months it takes to regrow that hair... But, luckily for us, aloe vera oil can help to speed up that tedious process.</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera leaf is full of vitamin E which has been proven to be effective in hair growth. In 2010 the National Institutes of Health did a <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank">small study looking at the benefits Vitamin E</a> has to offer. They found that Vitamin E helped people suffering from hair loss reduce oxidative stress —which is directly linked to hair loss. Vitamin E is a big component of aloe vera —and when mixed in oils like coconut or castor oil which are already famous for their hair growing attributes— the results can be incredible.</p>
<p class="f1">Mixing in a little Aloe Vera oil into your hair care routine for a few weeks can be greatly beneficial. Whether you suffer from hair loss or simply want to grow your hair out this is an excellent option for you.</p>

<h2 class="f2">2. Hair mask</h2>
<p class="f1">Do you suffer from dry, brittle and lifeless hair? Has your hair seen some damage from the sun, chlorine, or heat? If this is the case, Aloe Vera oil might be the perfect treatment for you. Even if you aren’t actively trying to grow out your hair, Aloe Vera oil contains vitamins and antioxidants that not only encourage growth—they help mend and prevent future damage.</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera contains vitamins that are crucial in maintaining healthy hair. For example, Aloe Vera is very rich in vitamin A. Vitamin A—or retinol— is a very popular and very important ingredient most commonly found in skincare. But did you know that Vitamin a is also crucial to your hair routine? Vitamin A helps to support oil secretion in your hair which helps to prevent hair breakage.</p>
<p class="f1">Despite not needing to grow out your hair, adding a quick aloe vera oil mask to your routine once a week will be very effective. Add the aloe oil to the ends and middle of your hair and let it sit for about 15-30 minutes. After you rinse thoroughly be prepared to feel a difference! The aloe vera and base oil will add serious moisture and shine!</p>

<h2 class="f2">3. Dry scalp</h2>
<p class="f1">There is nothing worse than a dry, itchy or flaky scalp. And, it’s even worse that all the top products recommended to treat this uncomfortable affliction are packed full of stripping chemicals that may leave the scalp less itchy, but wreck havoc on the ends of your hair.</p>
<p class="f1">Luckily, Aloe Vera is an all natural and very effective way to treat that pesky dryness! Another vitamin that is found in aloe vera oil is vitamin C. Vitamin C —most often found in an orange— is critical to your immune system, but did you know it can also help to treat dandruff? If your head has been more itchy than usual, or you’re finding small white flakes in your clothing or around your house, chances are you are suffering from dandruff. While this doesn’t seriously effect your health, it can be very uncomfortable to deal with.</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera oil can be very helpful when dealing with this issue. Vitamin C’s antioxidant features that are found in Aloe Vera help to clear out the dandruff and build up found in the scalp. And, when the aloe vera base oil is coconut oil, it helps with the dryness that leads to dandruff!</p>

<p class="f1">Aloe Vera oil can also help to combat dry skin, aging, and acne — all while being free of damaging and harsh chemicals. Keep reading to find out the top ways Aloe Vera oil can be used on your skin!</p>

<h2 class="f2">4. Dry Skin</h2>
<p class="f1">Dry skin —especially in the winter— can be very uncomfortable! When left untreated, dryness of the skin can develop in to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/aloe-vera-for-eczema" >eczema</a> —a condition that creates extreme dryness, to the point of redness, inflammation and even bleeding.</p>

<p class="f1">Aloe Vera oil can help to keep skin moisturized — and help to fight against infections. The cooling feeling of aloe mixed in with a moisturizing oil like coconut oil, jojoba oil or almond oil will leave your skin feeling incredible! By putting the aloe oil on the the afflicted area directly after a bath or shower you can lock in that moisture.</p>
<p class="f1">However, Aloe Vera oil should be used every other day or so when being used to treat dry skin. Due to its many enzymes which act like exfoliators, your skin can become more dry from over use! On the days you don’t use aloe vera oil be sure to still use a lotion or oil to continue fighting the dry skin.</p>

<h2 class="f2">5. Acne</h2>
<p class="f1">Millions of people world-wide suffer from acne every day. It’s something that can be frustrating and very difficult to treat. Most people go from product to product with little luck and are always looking for something new to try.</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera oil can also be very useful when treating acne. The enzymes help to clean and exfoliate the skin while the antioxidants found in the vitamins work to help cell turn over and kill harmful bacteria that could be causing the acne. Aloe Vera is an incredible stand-aloe spot treatment, but aloe vera oil simultaneously helps to moisturize.</p>
<p class="f1">NOw, when using the oil on your face it is best to use one with smaller molecules like rose hip oil instead of coconut. The smaller molecules are less likely to clog up your pores and perpetuate the acne!</p>
