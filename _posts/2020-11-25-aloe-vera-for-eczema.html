<h1 class="f3">Introduction</h1>
<p class="f1">Eczema is a very common skin condition that more than 3 million people —including me— suffer from.</p>
<p class="f1">The main symptom is a dry and itch rash that appears on the face, arms and behind the knees and it can range from mildly irritating to quite painful. If you suffer from eczema, chances are you’ll love using aloe vera to treat it.</p>

<h2 class="f2">Can Aloe Vera help treat Eczema?</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>Aloe Vera is a great way to treat eczema because of its all anti- inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. It’s a lightweight natural moisturizer that has light exfoliant chemicals, vitamin E and antioxidants that protect against infection as well as moisturize.</b></p>

<h1 class="f3">What is eczema?</h1>
<p class="f1">Before you can treat yourself for eczema, you have to make sure you actually have eczema. Luckily, it’s a very common condition that can usually be self-diagnosed.</p>
<p class="f1">Mild eczema can take the form of dry flaky skin. The more severe form of eczema can be seen in red, imitated and cracked skin. This is usually a dry discomfort or burning sensation. The most severe example of eczema can include making your skin ooze.</p>
<p class="f1">Eczema also runs in families. If you think you’re someone who has eczema, try asking a parent, sibling or relative if they also have those symptoms. If they do, and have been diagnosed with it, chances are you might too.</p>

<p class="w3">Warning!</p>
<p class="w1">Always go to your health care provider before taking drastic measures to treat your eczema. If you think you have serious eczema always go to your doctor to ask about potential prescription treatments.</p>

<h1 class="f3">Reasons why aloe excels when treating eczema</h1>
<p class="f1">Before we find out how exactly to treat our eczema with aloe vera, let’s look into why
aloe is so good at treating it!</p>
<p class="f1">The moisture, antiseptic agents, and anti-inflammatory properties all make aloe perfect for eczema.</p>
<p class="f1">It also contains a mild exfoliant called salicylic acid. Salicylic acid will leave your skin exfoliated from the inside out. Unlike a chemical exfoliant —like a scrub—, it won’t irritate your skin. Some scrubs can even cause micro-abrasions leading to pain and even infection. And, over exfoliating skin that suffers from eczema will never be beneficial.</p>

<h1 class="f3">How to treat eczema with aloe vera</h1>

<p class="f1">First, <b>you need to decide what form of aloe is best for you</b>. Aloe gel is the most popular, but aloe powder and oil all have their benefits. Read about all the forms of aloe below and see our favorite products from each type!</p>

<h2 class="f2">1. Aloe Leaf</h2>
<p class="f1">Keeping an aloe vera plants is one of the easiest ways to ensure you always have fresh aloe on hand. It’s an easy plant to care for and you get to reap the benefits of endless aloe gel!</p>

<p class="p3">Pro Tip</p>
<p class="p1">Check out our gardening posts to learn! How to plant, grow and harvest your very own aloe gel.</p>

<p class="f1">However, you do have to go through the extra steps of harvesting and storing your own aloe vera. this process can be tricky at first but with a little practice you’ll be able to do it in no time. Check out our other posts to learn how.</p>

<h2 class="f2">2. Aloe Gel</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera gel is a good alternative to the leaf if you don’t want the extra work or
harvesting the gel. You have to be careful to find one with 100% aloe gel or one that’s suitable for sensitive skin, however. The preservatives, dyes, fragrances and chemicals can irritate your already sensitive skin.</p>

<p class="p3">Pro Tip</p>
<p class="p1">Always do a patch test before using a new product! A patch test is when you place a small amount of the product on a non-sensitive part of your body to make sure you won’t have any.</p>

<p class="f1">Aloe gel contains vitamins like Vitamin A, Vitamin C , Vitamin E and B1 Vitamins that help with moisture. It’s also quite rich in minerals, enzymes and antioxidants that help to protect against infection. Avoid scratching the eczema affected area after you apply aloe gel because you nails could contain bacteria that leads to infection.</p>

<h2 class="f2">3. Aloe Oil</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera oil can help to keep skin moisturized and help to fight against infections. The cooling feeling of aloe mixed in with a moisturizing oil like coconut oil, jojoba oil or almond oil will leave your skin feeling incredible!</p>

{% endresponsive_image_block%}

<p class="f1">By putting the aloe oil on the the afflicted area directly after a bath or shower you can lock in that moisture. However, Aloe Vera oil should be used every other day or so. Due to its many enzymes which act like exfoliators, your skin can become more dry from over use! On the days you don’t use aloe vera oil be sure to still use a lotion or oil to continue fighting the dry skin caused by eczema.</p>

it any less special!</p>

<p class="f1">By dehydrating and grinding the leaf, you create aloe powder. It’s different from the aloe leaf or gel, but has its own benefits like higher concentration, and longer shelf life. Mix it with warm water until it dissolves to create your own aloe gel. Then, you can use it on it’s own or added to a heaver cream or lotion!</p>
