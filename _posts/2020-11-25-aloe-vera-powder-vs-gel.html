<h1 class="f3">Introduction</h1>
<p class="f1">If you’re like me, you probably love health and beauty recipes that you can do from home. And, chances are you've heard of the “super-plant” aloe vera. Aloe gel and aloe powder both have their benefits. But which form of aloe vera is best for your personal
needs?</p>
<p class="f1">By the time you finish reading, you’ll know which form of aloe is best for your needs and some ways to use it.</p>

<h2 class="f2">Aloe Gel vs. Aloe Powder. Which One Fits your Needs?</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>The gel form of aloe is more popular to use externally, helping to cool sunburns and soothe cuts. On the other hand, the powder form is more effective for internal health like the digestive and immune systems. Because of the instant cooling effects of aloe vera gel, it is the most popular form of aloe. But aloe powder’s high concentration and longer shelf life make it unique.</b></p>

<h1 class="f3">Aloe Vera Gel</h1>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera gel is created by draining and storing the juices found in the leaves of the aloe vera plant.</p>
<p class="f1">It’s commonly found in hand sanitizer to help moisturize, in henna ink, in lotions, and in hair care products. It’s been known to work wonders on burns, cuts, irritated skin and scars making it very popular.</p>

<h2 class="f2">Pros of Aloe Vera Gel</h2>
<ul>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Feel the cooling effects instantly.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Can be added to beverages.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Fresher than powdered aloe.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">100% aloe can be used in both drinks and external products.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="f2">Cons of Aloe Vera Gel</h2>
<ul>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Easily contaminated.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Not as strong as powder, bitter taste.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Shorter shelf life and needs to be stored in a fridge or freezer.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Impure aloe often has other additives to help with texture that aren’t safe to use internally.</li>
</ul>

<p class="w3">WARNING!</p>
<p class="w1">Since aloe vera gel can easily become contaminated with bacteria, its shelf life is usually no more than 6 months. To increase its shelf life, you can store it in your freezer or add vitamin E oil to it.</p>

<p class="f1">Here are some great aloe vera gel products. I love them all!</p>

<h1 class="f3">Aloe Vera Powder</h1>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera powder is created by dehydrating the plant and grinding the remaining juice into a fine powder. Aloe powder is often used internally —especially in drinks.</p>

<p class="f1">By mixing a little aloe powder in water or smoothie you get the internal benefits of the aloe vera plant, like the boost in your immune system, the high concentration of vitamin C and it’s help with the digestive system. Also, when mixed with a little bit of warm water the aloe powder turns into a more watery consistency. From there, it can be added (just like the gel) into lotions and other skincare items.</p>

<h2 class="f2">Cons of Aloe Vera Powder</h2>
<ul>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Lacks freshness.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">The powder needs to be mixed with water in order to use.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">Isn’t as easy as the gel, especially when using it externally.</li>
  <li class="f1 pb-0">A little more costly than gel.</li>
</ul>

<p class="f1">Here are some great aloe vera powder products, if you want to check them out!</p>

<h1 class="f3">Conclusion: powder or gel?</h1>
<p class="f1">While both of these forms have many of the same properties, benefits and the two are different nonetheless. On average, the cost of a gallon of aloe gel is a little more than the powder, but the powder goes a longer way due to its high concentration. All in all, it depends on what you want to get out of an aloe product.</p>
<p class="f1">Do you want something specifically for sunburns and skincare or are you looking for the inner benefits of this plant? Both aloe gel and aloe powder have their merits making it almost impossible to choose between the two. Aloe Vera is very beneficial to your health—inside and out.</p>
<p class="f1">If you want my advice... I say get both!</p>
