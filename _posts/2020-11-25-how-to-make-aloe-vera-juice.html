<h2 class="f2">How to make Aloe Vera Juice</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>Starting with your aloe.</b> First, if you’re using aloe straight from the plant, it's very important to use water to clean the outside of the aloe.</p>

<p class="w3">WARNING!</p>
<p class="w1">Be especially careful if you have a latex allergie. The toxic aloe vera latex could be particularly damaging to you. If you’re using store bought aloe leaves, it’s likely the yellow latex will have been released already but you should still be careful.</p>

<p class="f1">This warning is especially important to remember if you are picking your own aloe vera. If you choose to use store-bought please, do not forget to clean them nonetheless.</p>
<p class="f1">Carefully remove the yellow residue, or film off of the aloe by rinsing the aloe leafs gently in 8fl oz of water and about 3tsp of white vinegar. This will ensure that all the toxic substance is completely removed. After this is finished, scoop out the aloe gel with a spoon or knife. Then place it directly into your blender. Add your water or another other juice of your choice until you reach your desired consistency. Feel free to add your honey, lemon juice, or ice if you desire. Pour your drink and serve it! Or, put it into an airtight container and refrigerate it for no more than 5 days.</p>
<p class="f1">You can drink up to eight ounces of aloe vera daily, but if you struggle with the taste start small and work your way up.</p>

<h1 class="f3">Other ways to use Aloe Juice</h1>
<p1 class="f1">There are almost endless ways to enjoy aloe vera juice. You can use yours in a drink—or use it in a body / beauty routine!</p1>
<p1 class="f1">Aloe juice can be put in a spray bottle and used to add shine to hair or add moisture to your body. You can also mix your freshly made aloe juice in with your favorite cream to give it an extra kick! Or, freeze aloe ice cubes to make facial ice rolls.</p1>
