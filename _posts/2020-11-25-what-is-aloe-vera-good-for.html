<h1 class="f3">Introduction</h1>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera is one of the most popular ingredients in beauty and health products—and for good reason. It has been called a “super-plant” by many who enjoy its many benefits. While it’s most popular use is on sunburns and other skin conditions, aloe vera has so much more to offer!</p>
<p class="f1">Read more to find out how to use this incredibly useful plant!</p>

<h2 class="f2">What is Aloe Vera good for?</h2>
<p class="f1"><b>As one of the most versatile plants, aloe vera has an almost endless list of uses and benefits. It can be used in cosmetics, hair care and dietary supplements to name only a few. It has been known to help heal/fade scars and soothe burns. And when used internally, aloe can also help with creating stronger immune and digestive systems.</b></p>

<h1 class="f3">External Uses</h1>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera is most often used externally, and for good reason. It’s gentle chemical makeup, cooling sensation and almost non-existent side effects make it a safe bet when treating your ailments at home. Here are some of the best ways to use aloe vera externally!</p>

<h2 class="f2">1. Sunburns</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe’s most popular topical use is undoubtedly sunburns. It’s a top ingredient in after sun lotions and gels for its instant cooling effect and relief. But if aloe vera still isn’t cold enough for you, a good trick is to freeze the aloe leaf—or gel— in a ice cube tray. Once they’re frozen you can apply them to the burnt area and feel the relief!</p> 
<p class="f1">Usually, the most common aloe gel —for sunburns— is bright green and not as natural as we might think. To make sure you’re getting the most out of your products, look to see what additives are in the gel.</p>
<p class="f1">Sometimes, thickening agents, preservatives and alcohol added into the gel make it more harmful than good. Another important thing to remember is that if there are additives in the aloe gel you cannot drink it.</p>
<p class="f1">Here are some products that are effective without those harmful additives!</p>

<h2 class="f2">2. Eczema</h2>
<p class="f1">Eczema is a very common skin condition that causes skin to be enflamed and itchy. Since aloe vera has natural moisturizing and cooling effects, it has been known to soothe skin damaged by eczema.</p> 
<p class="f1">Sometimes, eczema can cause dry or cracked skin—sometimes even causing bleeding. The bleeding caused by eczema often makes the skin vulnerable to infections. Not only will aloe vera cool your skin, it will also help to protect against those infections.</p>

<h2 class="f2">3. Hair</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera is also known to help with hair growth, conditioning and even dandruff! Mixing aloe vera in with your favorite conditioner —or simply with water— helps to lock in moisture and protect hair from damage!</p>

<p class="f1">For hair growth, you can soak some rice in hot water, drain the water and mix in the aloe vera. This mixture is incredible for hair growth and shine and can be used multiple times a week! Aloe Vera is also added to shampoo and conditioner to help regulate the PH of your scalp.</p>

<h1 class="f3">Internal Uses</h1>
<p class="f1">Using aloe vera to treat the inside of your body may seem like the newest “super-food” trend, but it has been used internally for centuries!</p>
<p class="f1">From taking aloe vera vitamins to drinking it outright, there are almost infinite recipes and uses! It is packed full of antioxidants that help with your gut, cholesterol, and immune system making aloe vera very valuable!</p>

<h2 class="f2">1. Strengthens the immune system</h2>
<p class="f1">Drinking <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/how-to-make-aloe-vera-juice">aloe vera juice</a> is said to help build up the strength of your immune system!</p>
<p class="f1">It contains vitamins and minerals that greatly help your immune system. To name a few, Vitamin A, Vitamin C , Vitamin E and B1 Vitamins all are integral in creating a strong immunity against threats and also can help with cardiovascular problems, digestion and diabetes! The magnesium minerals found in aloe vera are also important for immunity!</p>

<h2 class="f2">2. Good for teeth</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera can also be used as toothpaste and mouthwash! This is a great alternative for people who have sensitive teeth because aloe doesn’t have any harsh ingredients or flavors that could cause pain.</p> 
<p class="f1">According to the <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/aloe-vera" target="_blank">NCCIH (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)</a> the cooling effect that makes aloe so popular for sunburns can also help reduce inflammation in gums caused by ailments like gum diseases.</p>

<h2 class="f2">3. Indigestion / gut health</h2>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera’s daily consumption is also believed to help poor digestion and constipation. The vitamins and antioxidants help to flush out toxins from your system when taken orally.</p>
<p class="f1">This is especially beneficial when taken early in the morning or at night before bedtime. The aloe plant is also very ideal in preventing or treating dehydration. The more fluids to take in during the day the easier it is for your liver and kidneys to purify your bloodstream. Aloe Vera can help you recover from exercise or illness where you lost fluids.</p>
<p class="f1">Try adding aloe vera juice to your water or smoothie after your next workout!</p>

<h1 class="f3">Conclusion</h1>
