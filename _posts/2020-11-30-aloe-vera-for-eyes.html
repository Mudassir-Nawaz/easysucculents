<h2 class="f2">Can Aloe Vera be used under the eyes?</h2>

<h1 class="f3">Benefits of Aloe Vera for Your Eyes</h1>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera may be your favorite eye cream yet! The gel is rich in minerals, enzymes and vitamins that are all beneficial. And, the gel is light and hydrating since it’s 98% water.</p>
<p class="f1">Your eyes are almost always the most sensitive part of your face. The skin around your eyes is substantially thinner than the rest of your face, making it more susceptible to irritation, cuts, swelling and inflammation. This is where aloe vera shines.</p>
<p class="f1"><b>Aloe helps to reverse all of these!</b> The enzymes provide gentle exfoliation that helps to keep wrinkles at bay. Furthermore, if you suffer from <b>small white bumps</b> on your eyelids or under your eye you should pay special attention! Those bumps are most likely <b>milia</b>, excess amounts of keratin trapped below the skin’s surface. Aloe’s exfoliating properties can help to release the trapped keratin and rid your skin of those pesky bumps. Using lotions or creams that are too heavy often lead to milia too, so using aloe vera instead will help prevent mills in the future.</p>
<p class="f1"><b>Dryness</b> is also common in the eye area. And, it’s one of the worst places to experience dry skin due to its sensitivity. It’s hard to resist scratching at the dry skin which can lead to even more issues! If you’re someone who does have dry skin and is tempted to scratch it, aloe is certainly the product for you. Aloe has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties that will help to keep infections at bay.</p>
<p class="f1">Using aloe vera at night, in the morning or reapplying when needed will help repair the skin barrier and lessen irritation — meaning less harmful scratches! If you have <b>red or inflamed eyes</b> it’s likely aloe vera could help you too! Aloe contains salicylic acid that help to calm irritated skin. If you get a painful sunburn on your eye area, aloe is the perfect ingredient to heal gently.</p>

<p class="w3">WARNING!</p>
<p class="w1">Though aloe vera is exceptional when used on your eyelid or under eye area, use cation! If aloe were to get directly on your eye it’s likely to cause discomfort. It’s not recommended to use aloe anywhere but on the outer eye area. </P>
