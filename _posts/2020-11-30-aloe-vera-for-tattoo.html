<h1 class="f3">Why you need to take care of your tattoo</h1>
<p class="f1">Tattoos take time and effort to heal. And, if done right, your tattoo will be vibrant for longer, fight off infections, and be pain free as soon as possible! So, taking care of your tattoo is an investment.</p>
<p class="f1">You need to take care of it for it to stay beautiful! Tattoos need to stay clean, dry and moisturized to heal properly and stay soft. There are consequences if you don’t take steps to care for your tattoo.  If there’s a lack of moisture in the area you might feel itchy—or even a painful burning sensation. And you might not be able to resist the urge to scratch it —leading to even more issues like infection.</p>
<p class="f1">Dry skin can also lead to cracking that could effect the look of your tattoo as the healing process comes to an end. As we can see, healing your tattoo properly is extremely important! Keep reading to find out ways aloe vera can be used in the healing process!</p>

<h1 class="f3">Why Aloe Vera is the perfect ingredient for your tattoo</h1>
<p class="f1">What makes aloe vera so special when it comes to tattoos? What sets it apart from other popular aftercare practices like lotions or petroleum jelly? Well, I’m glad you asked!</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe Vera is especially effective because it’s <b>antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal</b>! This means that aloe contains antiseptic agents like salicylic acid, cinnamonic acid and sulfur that kill fungi, viruses and bacteria. And all of this is necessary for your tattoo because it will be vulnerable to infections.</p>
<p class="f1">You need to keep it clean as it heals and aloe vera will accomplish this! Aloe Vera is also anti-inflammatory and can relive itching and burning sensations. This is the reason why it’s so popular to use on sunburns! This cooling affect will be heavenly on a painful tattoo! The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory simply cannot be found in cheap lotions or petroleum jelly.</p>
<p class="f1">Another reason why aloe is superior to those choices is breathability. Tattoos need to be able to breathe so they don’t trap moisture which leads to infection. Aloe is light enough to let the tattoo breathe, but not heavy enough to trap moisture.</p>

<p class="w3">WARNING!</p>
<p class="w1">Always check with your artist and listen to their advice prior to using any aftercare. The artists have experience that will help!</p>

<h1 class="f3">How to use aloe vera on your tattoos</h1>
<p class="f1">How do you use aloe on your tattoo? Always ask your artist’s opinion about when you can start using aftercare. But, usually you can begin this process after 24 hours. And all natural aloe vera is a safe bet.</p>
<p class="f1">After washing the skin, spread a generous amount of your aloe product over the tattoo. Then, cover with a sterile gauze to avoid contact with clothing or other external things.</p>
