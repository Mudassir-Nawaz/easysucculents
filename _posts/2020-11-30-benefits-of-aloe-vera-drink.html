<h1 class="f3">Top 5 Benefits of the Aloe Vera Drink</h1>

<h2 class="f2">1. Immune System</h2>
<p class="f1">Your Immune system is incredibly important! And, when there are problems in your immune system, it effects other areas other your body.</p>
<p class="f1">Since your immunity is so key to your overall health you need to pay special attention to it! Drinking aloe vera juice everyday, or every few days is said to strengthen and build up your immune system. To name a few vitamins and minerals that greatly help your immune system, aloe contains, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and B1 Vitamins.</p>
<p class="f1">Each of these are incredibly important to have! The zinc, magnesium, iron, and potassium minerals also found in aloe vera are very also important for immunity. If you aren’t taking supplements for these and are worried you might not be getting enough, aloe drinks can help with that!</p>

<h2 class="f2">2. Hydration</h2>
<p class="f1">The aloe plant is very water-dense. It’s 98.5% water, while the remaining 1-2% is made up of the organic acids, minerals and vitamins that your body craves. In short, drinking aloe vera drinks is an ideal way to prevent or treat dehydration —or to begin your day with.</p>
<p class="f1">Staying hydrated is very important to do on a daily basis. It helps your body flush out toxins and stay energetic and active. This is important, because your liver and kidneys are responsible for detoxing your blood and producing urine. But without prober hydration, it’s impossible for them to properly preform. For this reason, you need to keep them healthy and happy!</p>
<p class="f1">Recovery from exercise also requires a lot more rehydration than one might think! Your body requires extra fluids after a hard work out. Try adding aloe vera juice to your smoothie or water next time and feel the difference!</p>

<h2 class="f2">3. Constipation</h2>
<p class="f1">If you are someone who suffers from constipation, you know how unpleasant it can be.</p>
<p class="f1">Drinking aloe vera juice can help to increase the water density in your intestines. There’s a correlation between your intestinal hydration and your peristalsis (which helps you pass your stool).  Drinking aloe is also an all natural, chemical free option that is unlikely to irritate your stomach further!</p>

<h2 class="f2">4. Skin</h2>
<p class="f1">The hydrating aloe vera drink may also help your skin to glow! And even help reduce acne. As we know, Aloe vera  is rich in antioxidants and vitamins that help to heal and help to protect your skin.</p>
<p class="f1">Some compounds in aloe vera have even been shown to help neutralize the effects of (UV) radiation. And, help to repair your skin from preexisting UV damage. There are a lot of problems with UV damage that aloe can help… From preventing and helping fine lines and wrinkles, to stopping sun spots and damage. </p>
