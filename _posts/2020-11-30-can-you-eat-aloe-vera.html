<h2 class="f2">Can you eat Aloe Vera?</h2>
<p class="f1">Can you eat aloe vera is a very common question to hear. And <b>the answer is a resounding YES.</b></p>
<p class="f1">Aloe vera is not only able to be eaten—it should be! Although its understanding to be a little wary of aloe, you shouldn’t be! It’s a part of the succulent family, not the cactus family, and if poked by it you will not be hurt.</p>
<p class="f1">Aloe has been consumed for various reasons for hundreds of years. It’s been known as a healing “super-plant”. If you aren’t familiar with it —it’s time you become so!</p>
<p class="f1">Keep reading to find our top reasons why it’s actually a need! But you need to be careful with the kinds of gel you consume. <b>There is a stark difference between the aloe you are meant to consume, and the aloe you are meant to use topically as skincare</b>. You can usually tell these apart by the percentage of aloe on the bottles. Aloe that is meant to be consumed will usually be 100% aloe gel. It will also not have any preservatives, added perfumes or dyes.</p>
<p class="f1">Make sure to research your product thoroughly before consumption!</p>

<p class="w3">WARNING!</p>
<p class="w1">Always double check before eating aloe that it is meant to be consumed. And, when possible try and grow your own or buy it by the leaf.</p>

<h2 class="f2">Reasons to eat Aloe Vera</h2>
<p class="f1">Here are our top 3 reasons why aloe vera should be eaten on a regular basis! <b>Hydration, nutrition, and skin health.</b></p>
<p class="f1">Aloe is almost 100% water—but with the added benefits of vitamins. Eating a square or two of aloe vera will only benefit you as far as hydration goes. If you’re someone who struggles to drink the daily recommended amount of water, you should try eating your water instead! Aloe will be a great substitute and even add on the beneficial antioxidants!</p>
<p class="f1">Nutrition is very important. And, it’s hard to keep track of everything. This is one of the nicest things about the aloe plant. If you’re consuming it, you’re basically taking countless tiny vitamins. If you are somebody that struggles to remember taking vitamins, or if you lack the entire repertoire of vitamins, consider eating a slice of aloe instead. It’s basically a 75 in 1 —containing about 75 compounds!</p>
