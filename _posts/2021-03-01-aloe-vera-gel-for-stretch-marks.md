**If you want to minimize or remove stretch marks, aloe vera is a good option. While it might not cure the stretch marks outright, its vitamins, minerals and enzymes work to soften and heal skin. Its light exfoliation will also help to fade the stretch marks—as the marks are really scars.**

## What are Stretch Marks?

Stretch marks are a type of scar that develop when our skin stretches or shrinks abruptly. They look like thin lines, or streaks across the skin. They are extremely common and are most likely found in the breast, stomach, leg and buttock areas. They can occur for many different reasons too. Pregnancy, puberty, weight loss or gain and even genetic tendency or stress! Bottom line is: stretch marks do not make you ugly. 

They are a reflection of your body changing and should be treated as such! But, there’s no shame in wanting to minimize or hide them. And, aloe vera is a great way to do that! Keep reading to find out how to use aloe vera on your stretch marks, why it’s so effective and where you can get it! 

## How can Aloe Help with Stretch Marks?


Though many companies will brag that their product makes stretch marks disappear in days, the truth is more complicated than that.  If you’re attempting to get rid of, minimize or shrink your stretch marks you need to keep a few things in mind. First, stretch marks cannot and will not disappear overnight.  Treat them like you would a normal scar. It will take at least a few months to see changes—so don’t give up hope! Be patient with yourself and give yourself time before you give up! Secondly, keeping up a good routine is key. 

It won’t matter if you miss a few days here and there, but consistency with aloe vera will go a long way. We all know that aloe vera is a great healing and moisturizing agent. 

This is what makes it so effective when used on sunburns!  But, it also contains compounds that increase your collagen production, which will help to fade your scars. And, after all, stretch marks are scars more than marks. Aloe vera has been known to help lighten discoloration and help with dark spots. Because of this, aloe is also known to work very well on scars! Keep reading to find out how to use aloe on your stretch marks to reap the full benefits!

## Ways to use Aloe Vera on Stretch Marks

It’s a good idea to soften your skin prior to using aloe vera. If you use aloe on skin that has a little dampness, it will retain moisture better and leave your skin more hydrated and smoother!  Directly after showering, put aloe vera gel or juice onto the area or areas that are the most affected by the stretch marks. Gently rub it in and let it dry. 

Reapply if you would like. It’s recommended to repeat this process as often as desired— but once a night before sleeping, or in the morning are popular options. Remember, like we say above, give yourself time and consistency is key to seeing differences! Don’t become discouraged if you don’t see results right away.  

You’ll be glad you did when it’s worth it in the end.  If you suffer from drier skin, you might need a heavier moisturizer or cream to use on top of the aloe vera gel.  You can use your favorite body lotion, or, try using petroleum jelly which has also been known to work wonders on scarring caused by stretch marks.
