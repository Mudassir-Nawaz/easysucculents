## How to Use Aloe to Treat Mosquito Bites.

There are multiple ways to use Aloe vera when treating an insect bite. The first is to use pure aloe gel found in an aloe plant, and the other is to use aloe gel purchased at a store.

### 1. Aloe Plant

An Aloe plant is one of the most useful plants one can keep around the house. Using an aloe plant to treat a mosquito bite—or any bite that causes itchiness— is very easy and quite effective. First, clean the effected area with water and soap.

Then cut one of your aloe leaves into thin to medium sized slices.

Then, you gently rub the slices of Aloe onto your mosquito bite. Wait until the afflicted area has dried before adding any other creams, lotion, or clothing. You can repeat this process as many times as you want, or until the bite heals! Try to not reuse slices as the bacteria could cause infection if used more than once.

### 2. Aloe Vera Gel

Aloe Vera gel is also an excellent option when treating a mosquito bite. It’s perfect for someone who might not have a readily available Aloe Vera plant, but still wants to benefit from its incredible properties. Using Aloe Vera gel is very similar to using Aloe plant slices. Make sure the affected area is clean beforehand— preferably with soap and water. Then rub the gel generously onto the mosquito bite.
  
If Aloe Vera isn’t enough to stop the itching completely you can always add a heavier and stronger itch cream on top of the Aloe gel. And remember, though it is tempting to itch the area—don’t. The bacteria on your hands and nails could easily lead to infection.

## Why does Aloe Vera work so well with mosquito bites?

Aloe vera is a plant that is rich in antioxidants, minerals and enzymes so it’s no surprise that it works so well on mosquito bites. One thing that sets it apart from other methods is its antiseptic properties. Antiseptic means it helps to act against

fungi, viruses and infections before they can happen. Aloe contains six of these antiseptic agents: Salicylic acid, sulfur, urea nitrogen and others. It’s easy to forget the danger of infection when dealing with something as common as a mosquito bite—but it is very important to remember. Aloe vera is the perfect ingredient to have on hand—especially if you’re prone to bites! By dabbing on a little aloe you prevent infections, itchiness and inflammation!
