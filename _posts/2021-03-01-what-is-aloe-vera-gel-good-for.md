### 1. External

Reserving Aloe gel for only sunburns is a common mistake! Aloe’s cooling, moisturizing and smoothing effect can be used for far more.

### 2. Internal

Taking a spoonful of Aloe Vera gel in the morning may seem strange, but will likely have many benefits to your health. Aloe Vera is a very mild ingredient, so the risks and side effects are basically nonexistent. Taking a small amount of Aloe can work as a natural laxative, curing constipation. And, when taken during or directly before mealtimes, Aloe has also been researched to offer heartburn relief... 

And, even if you don’t suffer from heartburn or constipation, Aloe has something to offer you! Aloe gel basically acts as a liquid green vitamin. It’s packed with Vitamin A, B12, and C, as well as minerals like calcium, potassium, zinc, sodium and magnesium. Aloe helps lower blood pressure, promotes a healthy liver, and break down toxins.
 
Many people are surprised when they hear Aloe Gel can be taken internally. But it’s true, there are countless benefits to taking a few tablespoons of Aloe Vera gel by mouth every day. But, you do have to be careful. Most of the Aloe Vera gels found online or in stores have chemicals added for smell, coloring or as preservatives. 

These chemicals, while fine when used on a sunburn, should not be eaten. To avoid this, make sure you carefully research your Aloe Gel before purchasing and using it. Or, if you want to be 100% sure that there are no chemicals or preservatives, make your own Aloe gel from the houseplant by cutting the long spiky leaves into slices and scooping the gel from the inside out.
