## Topically

Aloe Vera is most popular for its topical treatment of sunburns—and for good reason— but the small but powerful plant is so much more than that! Aloe Vera cools imitated or itchy skin, locks in moisture, and helps to heal small cuts. 

Aloe Vera can be mixed with your go-to body lotion or oil to reap these benefits as well as used alone. Aloe juice can also be used as an after shower gel to keep skin soft and supple. Because of the more watery consistency of Aloe Vera juice, its best to add it to something thicker like a heavy lotion or cream. 

Aloe juice can be used alone and a little will go a long way! Aloe Vera juice is also free of harmful chemicals that are often found in aloe gels— and sometimes absorb into the skin. If you have sensitive skin, it’s likely that aloe juice is for you!
    
## Internally

The internal benefits of Aloe Vera are often overlooked when compared to the topical uses. But the fact remains, Aloe Vera can be used almost everywhere. Aloe Vera juice is especially effective when used internally. Its thinner consistency makes it easy to drink or add to smoothies or other juices. 

And, unlike aloe vera gel which is mostly intended for topical use, Aloe Vera juice is meant to be just that—a juice! While results might not appear overnight, be patient! Over time you’ll see the benefits of Aloe Vera juice. And while you wait for the long term results, enjoy your hydration!
