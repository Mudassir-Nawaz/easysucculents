## Succulents And Pets

At times, succulents and pets can live together comfortably, and, at other times, they can struggle to coexist. Houseplants are usually succulents, and your pets are safe around most of them. However, some plants can be harmful to your pet's health. 

Pets are safe around most succulents, but not all succulents are safe for pets; so you should avoid placing toxic ones indoors. Exposure to poisonous plants can cause breathing issues, heart issues, and vomiting in pets. These are the most common symptoms that affect the animal's health.
