## Introduction

{% include image.html image="close-look-of-succulent.jpg" alt="A close look of succulent" %}

Winters are coming, and our cute little succulents need protection. So I am really concerned about these trendy aesthetic plants. Aren't you? 

**To protect succulents from the wintertime, moving the plant indoors is a good idea. The plant needs to be placed in a spot it gets sufficient bright indirect light. Succulents prefer temperatures between 50°F and 100°F in winters.**

## How much coldness can succulents tolerate?

The degree of cold tolerance in succulents varies from region to region. But most tend to prefer temperatures between **60-80 °F**. 

Many people are surprised to know that some succulents can live outside the whole year, even in extremely cold conditions. These are {% include link-internal.html link="cold-hardy-succulents-outdoors" text="hardy succulents" %} that can bear low temperatures rather well. In fact, they can grow better outdoors than indoors. 

On the other hand, those plants that need more attention are called soft succulents. They should be moved inside before winter as soon as possible. They cannot stand frost. Last year, my succulent ended up rotting because I forgot to bring it inside before the onset of winter.

## How to prepare succulents for winter?

Succulents need protection from winter because this season can obliterate these plants. Therefore, it would help if you prepared your plants so they can survive the harsh weather. 

### 1. Bring Your Succulents Indoors

To prepare your succulent for winter, you must make sure to move them indoors in a smooth manner. The plant should not feel shocked by the transition.

The first thing you need to do is water your succulents a day or two before shifting them indoors. This step allows the plant to soak up the water it will need. Once the soil dries out, they are ready for the next step, checking out the soil and the pot. Succulents can grow well if they have excellent soil and a decent pot with a drainage hole. 

If you are tired of your own succulent soil, I have been using {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-make-your-own-succulent-soil-at-home" text="this method" %} for preparing succulent soil at home. And I really love it! This method is fantastic, and obviously, our succulents love this soil too. And they will thank you for putting them in good soil.

Once you are done with the above steps, then it's time to prepare your pot. Remove all the debris, dirt, and dead leaves from your succulent pot. These things can infect your succulents, so wipe them off. I love {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Garden-50-132-Repotting-Succulents/dp/B01CHK4SOY" text="my tool kit" %} for this purpose. This step will protect your succulent from rotting or getting any infection.

We don't want anyone to visit our pest-infected succulents. So inspect your succulents and look for any signs of the most common pest, mealybugs. If you suspect any bug, abolish it. Bugs love to hang out in our plants. Spider mites and fungus can be frequently seen in pots. Try to remove them to keep your succulents healthy.

Too much water will cause difficulty for your plants. Only provide them with enough water so that they can survive." %}

### How to treat your succulents once they are indoors?

When your succulents start living inside your house, there are a few things you have to keep in your mind:

1. **Stop giving it too much water.** Don't be excessive with the water you give your plant since the plant will not react kindly to it. Only give the plant enough water that it isn't dehydrated.
2. The next point is temperature. Ensure that you provide the plant with a suitable temperature that falls between 50°F to 70°F. Please give them a sunny spot in your home.
3. Adequate light is also essential for the survival of your succulents. As they have adapted to bright light during summer, you have to provide them with enough light that can help them stay alive. 
4. Keep looking for bugs. If there is any, then remove it on the spot. 
5. Take care of them as much as possible to keep them healthy and growing throughout winter.

## What is the right time to bring succulents indoors?

Whether you need to bring your succulent indoors or not depends on the climate of your area. If you live in a region where the temperature is between **50°F to 70°F** in winter, don't bring the plant indoors. Just take care and prepare them for winter outdoor. But if you are in a zone where the temperature falls below **40°F**, start preparing to bring them inside. 

I mostly bring my succulents inside when the temperature starts falling. Because in my region, frost has a significant impact on succulents. It would be best if you also took care of your plants.

## Conclusion

Taking care of your succulents in winters requires you to water them less as the plant is most likely dormant. Perhaps you may have to move it inside unless the surrounding temperature is between 50°F and 100°F. Take care of the plant and ensure no pests are damaging it. 
I hope that this will help you in preparing your succulents for winter. Keep in mind that the winter season has some adverse effects on our succulents. The amount of water is the most essential thing that you have to take care of.
