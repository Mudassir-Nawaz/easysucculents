You can stop the Monstera leaves by doing the following:

### 1. Water the Plant Properly

Watering indoor plants sounds simple, but most of us struggle to do it correctly. One tricky thing to figure out is how much water a plant needs and how often it needs it. Experts suggest that the proper time to water the Monstera plant is whenever the topmost soil in the pot is dry.

When watering, you should avoid the following:

- Underwatering: The plant is likely to be dehydrated when it starts to wilt or have brown leaves. However, you do not want your lovely Monstera to reach this point. Therefore, stick your fingers in the soil to check if the soil is moist. If it is extremely dry, the plant may be in need of hydration. Alternatively, lift or tilt the pot carefully to estimate the wetness of the soil. 

- Overwatering: Pots feature drainage holes for a significant reason. Overwatering destroys the plant as roots require oxygen to survive. Improper drainage promotes excess soil moistness, which in turn overwhelms the roots and causes root rot. Additionally, moisture causes bacteria and fungi to grow in the soil. This growth produces an odor that you can notice. Other signs of overwatering are yellow leaves, lack of new growth, and wilting. Check these signs and reduce the amount of water you give the plant if you suspect overwatering.

Here are tips for watering the houseplant
- Choose the correct watering can: The best watering can have a long spout, such as {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/IKEA-403-941-18-Vattenkrasse-Watering-Ivory/dp/B07QRWG9YS " text="the IKEA Vattenkrasse watering can"%} . It controls water around the soil, thus prevents the leaves from becoming wet. 
- Have a schedule: it is not ideal to wait for your houseplant to dry. Have a schedule to check it out at least twice a week. You can download apps such as Happy Plant or waterbug to set a reminder.
- Time of the day: Water in the morning rather than the evening. This is because the splashes on leaves will dry during the day when the temperature is warm.

### 2. Fulfill its Humidity Needs

If there is high humidity, water droplets condense onto the leaves and fall into the soil. However, when humidity is low, plants tend to dry quicker; hence they need to be watered more frequently. When humidity is too high, water may pool over leaves and act as a breeding ground for fungi. 

{% include image.html image="monstera-leaves.jpg" alt="An image of monstera leaves" %}

Fortunately, the Monstera plant only needs average humidity levels as anything around 40% keeps it healthy.

Here is what you can do to maintain or check the humidity:

- Use a hygrometer:  a hygrometer will help measure humidity levels. If you notice the average humidity is below 40%, then the curling leaves are due to low humidity. 
- Use a humidifier: the best way to humidify a room is through a humidifier. 
- Grouping: group your monstera plants together so that they can share humidity. The moisture of plants contributes to the humidity of the surrounding area. 
- Enclosures: a sealed greenhouse contains humidity better than the whole house.

### 3. Moderately Fertilize the Plant

Monstera needs fertilizer to grow healthy. However, excess fertilizer makes the leaves start curling. Also, it makes the plant weak and encourages the growth of pests.  It is recommended to fertilize once a month during summer and spring. There are many common and effective ways to fertilize the plant. Some of the best ways of fertilizing are: 

- Use liquid fertilizer:   {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Jacks-Classic-Purpose-20-20-20-Soluble/dp/B001REA5NK" text="use 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer"%} and dilute it in a gallon of water. Apply the solution directly to the soil and do not let any water fall on the leaves. Lastly, ensure you get rid of excess liquid. 
- Slow-release granular fertilizer: use a quarter of a pound of the fertilizer in a new plant after eight weeks to boost the growing process. This fertilization method ensures an equal concentration of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and magnesium.

### 4. Use High-Quality Water

Choose the right water for your Monstera plant. While you may think that tap water is safe for the plant, this is not always true. Softened water contains salt that can collect over the soil and cause issues to the plant. The temperature of the water also matters as the succulent doesn't like overly cold water. 

{% include image.html image="monstera-leaves-1.jpg" alt="An image of monstera leaves" %}

Another option you can consider to water your plant is using rainwater. However, do not collect rainwater if you live in a polluted.  Whatever you do, don't forget to use a filtration system to purify the water and make it safer for the plant.

### 5. Prevent heat stress

While succulents are adapted to heat stress, most tropical plants, including Monstera, are not well equipped to deal with heat. This plant grows in a tropical climate. Generally, Monstera indicates heat stress by leaf curling. 

In case of a heatwave, the plant will turn weak due to insufficient water and nutrients. The condition of the plant can worsen if the problem is ignored for a long time. Curling indicates water loss. When the plant is given adequate care, the problem can be minimized. Try to avoid direct sunlight to keep the leaves shiny and healthy.

You can care for your plant in hot weather by:
- Watering: water twice a day during high temperatures. Water it only until water starts pouring out of the drainage hole.
- Use water granules on the pot: the granules release water into the soil.
- Shade: move the plant to a shadier location during the day. 

### 6. Fulfill Its Light Requirements

Besides its water requirements and humidity needs, Monstera also wants proper exposure to filtered sunlight. Therefore, you have to place it in a spot where it can get medium levels of indirect sunlight.  

{% include image.html image="monstera-leaves-2.jpg" alt="An image of monstera leaves" %}

The human eye can deceive you about the level of light. If you are not sure about lighting conditions in your room, here is a simple method to measure light in your space:

- Pick a spot in the house where you intend to place the plant. 
- Choose the brightest time of the day, like noon, hold up your hand, and look at the shadow.
- High levels of light will show stark contrast and clearly defined shadows.
- Low levels of light will show unclear shadows and outlines.

### 7. Ensure Proper Drainage

Overwatering plants in pots contribute to poor drainage. According to FAO of the United Nations, healthy soil has several air spaces within the soil. When the air pores are saturated with water, root tissues begin to die. This makes the plant lack carbon dioxide and oxygen. You will then identify signs like curling. 

{% include image.html image="monstera-leaves-3.jpg" alt="An image of Monstera leaves" %}

If you notice the problem, you have to get rid of the contaminated soil and put it in a hot composting system. This process will remove available pathogens.  Use fresh ingredients to repot your plant. Make sure you have a mask and gloves during the process. Before watering the plant, check the soil to feel if it is dry or wet.

You can tell if the soil is poorly drained if:
- The leaves start to turn yellow or brown due to the nitrogen that is leaching out.
- The soil surface forms algae
- The soil becomes aerobic and starts to smell
- Plant roots begin to change color 

### 8. Protect the plant from pests and diseases

Monstera is often attacked by spider mites which are difficult to see with the naked eye. These insects can attack the large leaves and cause curling. This happens because the spider mites depend on the plant for food. 

It is essential to take precautions to avoid the growth of pests and diseases in your indoor plants. When you purchase a new plant, put it into isolation from other plants. This will help you determine if there are insects in the new plant. To add to that, scrutinize plants before you buy. 

Check for common signs like clear sticky sap, insect damage, and webs. Use clean soil and pots because insect eggs like dirty pots. Other precautions include giving your plant enough light and refraining from overwater. 

## Conclusion 

To ensure your Monstera plant's leaves don't curl, water it properly, maintain proper humidity, give it sufficient sunlight, fertilize it just right and prevent pests from attacking the plant.
