### 1. The Ideal Soil for Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="Thankfully, the Begonia Maculata isn't too fussy when it comes to soil!" %}

Begonia Maculata loves moderately moist soil. The soil should be loamy and be mixed with clay and sand. It may also have some fibrous compost and extra perlite to enhance growth and promote proper drainage. Additionally, it will flourish if the soil meets its pH requirements of being between 6.5 and 7.2.

When placing the subshrub within a pot, make sure you put a layer of pebbles on the bottom. The idea is to promote proper drainage. After all, the soil's top layer needs to dry out, which would be impossible without good drainage.

### 2. Sunlight Requirements of Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="It is vital to moderate the sunlight exposure to the Begonia Maculata!" %}

The evergreen indoor plant can handle two sunlight situations, namely bright indirect light and low-light situations. Refrain from keeping it in spots that have absolutely no sunlight. The Polka Dot Begonia allows you to place it indoors as it can thrive within the home.

{% include image.html image="Image2.jpg" alt="Gorgeous Begonia Maculata flowers." %}

If you want, you can move the plant outdoors for a few hours to get it a dose of sunlight. However, be careful and moderate the time it spends there.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Don't let the Begonia Maculata get sunburnt!" content="If you take out your Begonia Maculata to catch some sunlight, make sure to bring it inside soon. Never put it under direct sunlight, even if you place it outdoors. If you do, you might end up with the stunning leaves getting sunburns, so don't take a risk!" %}

When you allow the plant to take in higher light levels, expect it to have stronger growth and blooms. However, you need to make sure it doesn't experience too much temperature variation.

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="When you move your plant outdoors, please bring it back before nighttime. If the temperature falls too much, the plant can suffer substantially. After all, it is highly sensitive to changes in temperature." %}

To sum it all up, you need to provide the Begonia Maculata with bright indirect light or low-light situations. You can acclimate it to the sun a bit, but too much direct sunlight is a big no.

### 3. Ideal Humidity for Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="The Begonia Maculata is native to Brazil and hence loves humidity." %}

You may need to monitor humidity levels because the evergreen Spotted Begonia appreciates high levels of humidity. Ideally, the plant wants more than 45% humidity.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" content="Consider investing in a digital hygrometer so that you can keep an eye on the humidity level near your Begonia Maculata. Keep a bowl of water near the Begonia Maculata, or invest in a humidifier if the humidity level is too low." %}

If you don't have a digital hygrometer, don't sweat it. I have handled many succulents, and I know the best gear that you can get. I recommend the {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/AcuRite-Humidity-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Indicator/dp/B0013BKDO8" text="AcuRite Digital Hygrometer"%} for the job!

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="" link="https://www.amazon.com/AcuRite-Humidity-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Indicator/dp/B0013BKDO8" description="AcuRite Digital Hygrometer" image="Amazon2.jpg" %}

If you're committed to maintaining a high humidity level indoors, you should also invest in a humidifier. I'll recommend this awesome {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FJTVHKO" text="one"%} if you're interested.

### 4. How Should I Water Begonia Maculata?

{% include quote.html quote="While the Begonia Maculata has average water needs, you need to ensure that the topsoil dries before rewatering." %}

Since the Begonia Maculata prefers moderately moist soil, refrain from letting it dry out completely. Be careful with the way you water this subshrub, and you're good to go. Otherwise, expect to see your plant wither away in no time. 

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="The Begonia Maculata is highly susceptible to root rot. Therefore, refrain from overwatering it as soggy soil is a recipe for disaster." %}

If you let too much time pass before you water the plant, you might witness it dropping leaves. You can also expect the leaves to show crispy brown edges that don't look pretty at all.

{% include image.html image="Image3.jpg" alt="The Spotted Begonia in an exquisite pot." %}

If you're overwatering the plant, expect the leaves to turn yellow and drop more often than not. Be patient with this plant and try to find the right balance. Water the plant often enough so that it is hydrated but do let the topsoil dry in between. 

### 5. Fertilizing your Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="When your Begonia is growing out, consider fertilizing it every two to four weeks." %}

Like any other plant, the Polka Dot Begonia also needs fertilizer every now and then. You can expect to fertilize it every two to four weeks. I want to add that you don't need to fertilize it over winters as it won't experience much growth.

While the market is brimming with fertilizers, never compromise on the one you purchase. I have vast experience with gardening, and I believe that you should get {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Peters-51024-Classic-10-30-20-Fertilizer/dp/B00JDRWE0K" text="Jack's Classic Blossom Booster Fertilizer"%}.

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="" link="https://www.amazon.com/Peters-51024-Classic-10-30-20-Fertilizer/dp/B00JDRWE0K" description="Jack's Classic Blossom Booster Fertilizer" image="Amazon4.jpg" %}

You can apply fertilizer when you water the plant. However, make sure that you limit the product's usage to the growing period of the Spotted Begonia.

### 6. Pruning your Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="Your plant could use semi-regular pruning, so don't hesitate to do it every once in a while." %}

**Are you wondering how to prune Begonia Maculata? According to the {% include link-authority.html link="https://www.begonias.org/Articles/Vol43/TrainingPlants.htm" text="American Begonia Society" %}, you shouldn't be afraid of cutting off protruding stems to give the plant a better shape. Moreover, if there is just a single stem that is too long, shorten the cane to about 10 inches of the pot.** 

The Begonia Maculata can use somewhat regular pruning. Based on my experience, I advise you that trimming and pruning the evergreen indoor plant is the best way to go. After all, pruning is necessary for plants that have overgrown and need shaping. 

### 7. Repotting your Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="In early life, the evergreen subshrub benefits from frequent repotting." %}

{% include image.html image="Image4.jpg" alt="A close up of a Begonia Maculata Leaf" %}

The best practice is to repot the Begonia Maculata annually. This plant prefers to be pot-bound but may feel exhausted with densely packed roots. Therefore, when you're approaching Spring and plan to repot the plant, go up a size with the pot. 

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="Don't get too enthusiastic when getting a new pot for your plant. Don't purchase a pot that is much larger than the previous one. The greater the size, the more likely your Begonia will suffer because of soil that stays wet for too long." %}

When you're repotting the Begonia Maculata, don't forget to add in some fibrous compost and potting soil to save the day. You'll thank me for it later!

## Things You Should Know About Begonia Maculata

If you’re raising a Begonia Maculata at your home, there are a few things you must know. 

### 1. Propagation of your Begonia Maculata

{% include quote.html quote="The Begonia Maculata is surprisingly easy to propagate through cuttings!" %}

The Begonia Maculata is one of the easiest plants to propagate. While you could plant seeds, it is easier to cut a portion of the plant and grow it into a new one. 

The ideal time to propagate the spotted Begonia is winter. Since there is minimal blooming, you can cut off a stem with no flowers and dip it in a jar of water.

Step-by-step propagation through stem cutting involves pulling up the stem from under the soil. Cutting sections with a knife about 1 inch in length while removing leaf stems from them. You can then place a single stem in a prepared seedling pot. With thorough monitoring, you'll be good to go and have a Begonia growing in no time.

If you're new to propagating succulents and are looking for more thorough advice, I have you covered. Please read our guide that will teach you {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-propagate-succulents" text="how to propagate succulents" %}.

Are you wondering whether the Begonia Maculata is toxic? It definitely is toxic; therefore, you need to keep it away from pets. Ingesting it will cause side effects that you would want to avoid at all costs.
