So, the best solution is to grow the mother of thousands of kalanchoe in a small container or pot. Also, never plant kalanchoe in a pot without a drainage hole.

Excess water will drain into the tray from the hole. That way, you can save your place from getting dirty and your plant will remain healthy too. Make sure to empty the tray every day." %}

### 2. Expose it To Abundant Levels Of Sunlight

Who says that only humans and animals need sunlight? Sunlight gives us vitamin D. But what it delivers to a plant is much more than vitamin D.

Mother of thousands plant needs an abundance of indirect sunlight. If you place it in direct sunlight, it will get sunburned so refrain from putting your plant in danger. 

Scorched leaves look unpleasant. You don't want your succulent to have them. So, please place the plant in a shady area especially in warm weather.

If you're keeping it indoors, a window facing east is the perfect place for it. Mother of thousand loves a good drench of morning sun!

But **how do you know that your mother of thousands is getting enough light?** The answer is fairly simple. The plant is getting enough sunlight when the leaves are bright green with red edges.

### 3. Protect Your Plant From Excessive Heat

Optimum temperature is a basic need to function well. Too much heat can dry out the plant.

Then **what is the perfect temperature of a mother of thousands?** The optimum temperature for a mother of thousands is 16 to 24 degree Celsius (65 to 75 degree Fahrenheit).

When the heaters of your home are switched on in the winters, place the plant away from the source of heat. This heat will make the plant look dreadful. Moreover, a baked plant is difficult to recover.

### 4. Fertilize the Plant once every three months

Finally, please pay attention to the amount of water you give to the plant. 

Kalanchoes is very similar to cacti. They do not need much water or, you can say kalanchoes are sensitive to water. If you own it, this question must have crossed your mind.

**How often should I water my mother of thousand succulent?**

In summers, you can water mother of thousands every 4 to 5 days. Make sure the top two inches of the soil is dry before you water it.

As I said at the start, you should use a pot with a drainage hole. The plant does not survive in soggy or moist soil. The drainage hole in the pot will help get rid of excess water. That way, your plant has a higher likelihood of being healthy and strong!
