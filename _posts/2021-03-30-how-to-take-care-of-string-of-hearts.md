I have aligned all the tips you would need to follow to take good care of the String of hearts plant.

### Light conditions 

This plant enjoys bright light but doesn't like direct sunlight. The best option would be to expose it to filtered light. If you notice large spaces between leaves, then readjust the lighting conditions.

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="Large quantities of direct sunlight will scorch the leaves. If you want to save your plant from getting sunburned, you must keep it away from aggressive light during the day! Otherwise, be prepared to see your plant suffer." %}

### Temperature: 

The String of hearts enjoys warmer conditions and should ideally be exposed to temperature levels between **65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C)**. That is why they will grow well in regions between USDA Zones 9 to 12.

Only choose to get this succulent if the climate you expose it to will be suitable! Otherwise, you risk killing a plant for no good reason. 

### Watering:

You should check the soil before watering the plant. If the topmost soil is dry, then you can proceed to water your plant. The soil should be slightly moist in summers and fall. The plant is dormant during winter and fall so that it will consume lesser water. You can adjust the amount of water you give to the plant according to the season.

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="Overwatering the String of hearts plant is a terrible idea. Not only can it cause root rot, but it can also make the leaves excessively soggy!" %}

### Fertilizer:

The best thing you can do is use a fertilizer specifically made for succulents. For best results, you should feed the plant during its active period between May and August. The plant needs no fertilizer during its dormant period so don't waste resources to feed it during that time!

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="" content="Use a fertilizer with a low quantity of nitrogen to see the String of Hearts plant flourish!" %}

### Repotting:

The String of hearts benefits from repotting and if you own a small desktop plant, try repotting it every **12-18 months**. For a larger plant, try repotting it every **18-24 months**. They have sensitive vines so be careful when you transfer it to another pot. The best time to repot String of hearts is during summer. During the summers, the plant is growing and can adapt itself to a new enclosure easily!

## Propagating my String of heart

{% include image.html image="image-1.jpg" alt="String of hearts propagating" %}

The String of hearts plant is known for its robust growth and can get tangled quite easily. Therefore, you need to propagate the plant to give it the desired direction. I will suggest four common ways of propagating the plant effectively!

### 1. Water propagation:

In this method, you take few cuttings from your plant and submerge them in water. Then you ensure that the cutting you are placing within the water doesn't have any leaves. Similarly, the part above should have some leaves. The larger the cutting used to propagate the plant, the more likely it is to flourish.

### 2. Soil propagation:

This method is almost the same as the water method. Except, now you place the cuttings in soil. To increase the chances of each cutting's growth, you can dip them in {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Safe-Rooting-Hormone-93194/dp/B00AA8WPGY/ " text="TakeRoot Rooting Hormone"%} which is available on Amazon.

### 3. Regrowth in the same vessel:

For this method, you take the lower part of your vine and place it above the pot forming a circle. Then, you can gently dip the lower parts of the plant in the pot or pin them using a clip, etc. You need to ensure the plant gets bright light and the soil is moist to enhance the chances of good growth.

### Tuber Propagation:

For this method, you will need to get a maximum-sized tuber. After that, you simply leave this on the vines and push it in the soil to grow roots. You can cut the vine from the mother roots as soon as it grows roots.
