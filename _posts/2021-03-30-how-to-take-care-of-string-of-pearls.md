{% include image.html image="string-of-pearls-propagation.jpg" alt="String of Pearls plants getting fuller" %}

Here are a few things you have to take care of to ensure good health for your plant:
 
### Light Requirements
 
The String of Pearls plant needs a combination of direct and indirect sunlight to thrive. To achieve this, the best thing you can do is place it on a sunny windowsill. 
 
If your plants are placed outdoors, place them under partial shade so that they can enjoy a little bit of direct sunlight without getting sunburned.
 
If you are struggling with providing sufficient light to your string of hearts plant, you may even consider getting a grow light! After all, it will aid the growth of your plant.

### Ideal Temperature and Humidity

The String of Pearls plant will flourish in temperatures between 50°F and 80°F (10°C-27°C). However, it has low frost tolerance so don't let it suffer because of harsh winter conditions.

Your plant doesn't like too much humidity so avoid placing it in the kitchen or the bathroom. 

### Watering Requirements

To take care of the String of Pearls, you need to water it once in two weeks. But you will need to reduce the frequency in the wintertime to once every month.  The plant classifies as succulent and stores sufficient water in its leaves. Please don't make the mistake of overwatering it, as it will react poorly.

Though the String of Pearls is often grown indoors, it can also make an outdoor plant. But you will need to adjust the watering frequency according to how hot your location is.

### The Right Amount of Fertilizer

Fertilize the string of hearts plant once every two to four weeks during the growing season between Spring and Summer. Otherwise, avoid feeding it in the dormant season as the plant won't tolerate it well.

This succulent will appreciate being fertilized with a water-soluble fertilizer that is diluted to half its strength.

### Pruning
 
You need to constantly prune your String of Pearls plant to maintain its health and aesthetics. You will cut off both dead leaves and stems. All stems that have lost a lot of beads must also be trimmed off. 

Pruning will benefit your String of Pearls plant by allowing it to grow back in a better way while improving and maintaining its appearance and size.

## What is the Best Time to Repot Your String of Pearls?

It is good to do this in the first month of spring. It is time to repot the plant if it begins to outgrow the container, becomes rootbound, and you see roots stick out of the potholes.

The remedy of such a situation is salvaging the plant by removing damaged parts.
