## Introduction

Succulents come in a variety of shades, colors, textures types, and even rarity levels. Some of them are so unique and exotic that they can even fetch a high price in the market. These plants are exceptional and hence effortlessly capture the attention of onlookers.

**The Ruby Necklace, Little Jewel, Living Rock Cactus, Calico-Hearts, Blue Rose, Moon Cactus, Wine Cup, Basket Ball Plant, Crinkle Leaf Plant, and Pebbled Tiger Jaw are some of the most exotic succulents from around the world.**

Let's have a look at some of the most unusual and alien-looking succulents from around the world. Wine Cup and Moon Cactus are my personal favorite.

## What Are Succulents?

Succulents mostly grow in a dry, arid climate, where they have to resist drought. They adapt to their environment by storing water in their leaves, stems, or roots. The plant is usually thick and fleshy because of these factors. At times, these storage mechanisms are guarded by thorns to discourage any thirsty predators from attacking the plant. This survival strategy makes succulents stand apart from other plants. 

## 15 most exotic succulents
