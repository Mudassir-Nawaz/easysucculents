## Common Outdoor Succulents 

Unlike indoor succulents, outdoor succulents are generally larger. Consequently, outdoor succulents need more light to aid their growth. 

If you're looking for a succulent to place in the garden, these are the ones you should consider:

### 1. Hen and Chicks

Hens and Chicks are among the most common outdoor succulents. They get their name because of the pattern in which they grow. The mother plant or the hen is at the center of the rosette, and the daughter plants or the chicks are at its rim. The formation of chicks makes these plants sprawl horizontally. Due to this reason, these plants are suitable to place in gardens.

The rosette formed by Hen and Chicks is usually green in color. However, excessive watering can make the Hen part yellowish in color. So, if you are planning to get one, make sure you don't overwater the plant.
