Grafting cactus plants can also be done to make unique forms, like weeping plants.
 
This can be advantageous for {% include link-authority.html link="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12165" text="slow-growing species" %} (such as Ariocarpus), sensitive species which are difficult or impossible to develop in their roots (such as the mutant Gymnocalycium mihanovichii, which form the very best portion of "Moon Cacti"), or even to conserve a species which would otherwise perish (such as a cactus that's rotting and leaving behind very small tissue to try to re-root).

When people or organizations are producing these cacti, they refer to this chunk cactus and the scion.
 
The scion is a youthful item of the plant used for grafting.

### Briefings about the bottom cactus (rootstock)?

The bottom cactus is a Hylocereus undatus, occasionally known as a pitaya or dragon fruit.
