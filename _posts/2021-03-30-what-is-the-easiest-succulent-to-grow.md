faq: 
- question: Are succulents easy to grow indoors?
  answer: Succulents require minimum care and hence make a perfect indoor plant. This is mostly because they are able to store water in their stems, leaves and roots. Plus, they come in a variety of textures and shapes to match the decor of your home.
- question: Do succulents need full sun?
  answer: Succulents, like any other plant, love the sun and should get enough sunlight. Ideally, you must put them in sun for about 6-7 hours. However, you want them to get used to sunlight slowly as they won't be able to take it if they are used to being placed in the shade.
- question: Do succulents need lots of water?
  answer: Succulents are hard-to-kill plants that can store water for a long period of time. They donâ€™t need a lot of water and should only be watered when the soil feels bone dry. The soil should be left to dry between waterings.

## 7 Easy growing succulents you must have at home

Now, let's check some of the easiest growing succulents you can bring home right away. Do stay till the very end as we have an exciting infographic prepared just for you! Let's get started.

### 1. Aloe *(Aloe vera)*

You can never go wrong with Aloe. Extremely popular for its {% include link-internal.html link="what-is-aloe-vera-gel-good-for" text="medical properties" %}, Aloe can grow up to a height of two feet and produce beautiful flowers too. 

This African native mainly blooms from February to September. It is one of the most common succulents with leaves that help funnel water and keep the plant moist. 

However, these do not bloom well when put indoors. 

If you are specifically looking for an Aloe that grows indoors, you must go for Tiger Aloe. These are some of the least-attention-requiring and easy-growing succulents out there.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Aloe Vera Benefits" content="If you are health and beauty conscious, the Aloe plant is for you. The inner gooey substance is rich in antioxidants and vitamins that will reduce the impact of UV on the skin, repair your skin, and prevent wrinkles!" %}

You can purchase the perfect Aloe vera plant from a trustworthy seller. I have bought it from one, and I am so thankful. Here is the {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Costa-Farms-Aloe-Vera-Plant/dp/B01ERMWHTS" text="plant"%} that you can purchase!

### 2. Crassula

Fancy small-to-medium succulents? Crassula (pronounced 'KRASS-oo-la') can be your thing, given how broad the range of this particular species is.

Crassulas are from Africa, and therefore, have superb water management properties. They can go long without water but do require the usual care that succulents need.

The leaves on Crassula are pretty distinct in the way they are arranged. The patterns vary quite a lot. However, they have one common characteristic - the leaves are fleshy. 

Another important thing you'd like to know about Crassula is that they are dominantly low-growing succulents. They develop branching stems and generally have dense foliage.

I love the Jade plant and I know you will too. I bought it from {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Portal-Cool-Jade-Plant-Succulent/dp/B07KVYPF3C" text="here"%}!

### 3. Houseleek *(Aeonium)*

Houseleeks are beautiful succulents that you don't want to get attached to. Why? Keep reading.

So, houseleeks usually grow to a height of three feet and prefer being outdoors than indoors. And they are extremely beautiful. 

The floral embellishment on the houseleek gives it a distinctive color and texture, making it a perfect plant if you have a knack for decoration.

Okay, here's what's wrong with them - houseleeks are monocarpic. That means they won't be with you for long. Once they flower, they'll die. However, they do produce offshoots to keep the 'legacy' going.

If you want to get the Houseleek plant, I know just the place you can consider. Here is a reliable {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Cuttings-Aeonium-arboreum-Purple-Succulent/dp/B082ZCJGSF" text="seller"%}!

### 4. Zebra Plant *(Haworthia attenuata)*

Zebra plant comes from the African continent and, quite understandably, has a strong will to live. In other words, they can survive in adverse conditions - making them one of the easiest succulents to grow!

Although their structure might resemble that of an aloe plant, they have many distinct features you'd love. First, they have the white variegated stripes all over them, hence the name 'Zebra plant'. 

Then they have the thick and pointed leaves - so they might not need a lot of watering. However, these are slow growers. So, you better be patient with them. 

Feel free to purchase the gorgeous {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Haworthia-Attenuata-Zebrina-Succulent-Plant/dp/B00TQQN2J0" text="Zebra Cactus plant"%}!

### 5. Panda Plant *(Kalanchoe tomentosa)*

The name might seem taken from the movie 'Kung Fu Panda'. But, these easy-growing succulents are originally from the country 'Madagascar'. These are some of the most common *Kalanchoe* succulents and have the typical features of a plant found in Madagascar.

The panda plants usually grow to a height of two feet, accompanied by really slow growth, hence the name 'Panda'. The leaves on these succulents are gray-green and have soft hairs all over them. The brown spots on the leaves are an instant giveaway, though.

To quicken panda plant's growth, you should consider putting them in bright sunlight and giving the soil enough time to soak water and dry. Most importantly, don't let the water droplets stay on their leaves or else they'll begin to rot.

You might be attracted towards this lovely succulent. I have vast experience buying succulents online, and I know where you can get the {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Pandan-Pandanus-Amaryllifolius-Live-Plant/dp/B01KNO6IMG" text="panda plant"%} with confidence.

### 6. Snake Plant *(Sansevieria trifasciata)*

Snake plant has one and only one life mantra - what might kill you only makes you stronger. We are not mincing words here. It's a legendary succulent with a true hard-to-kill attitude.

Yes, these can survive anything. We are talking weeks without light and water and showing no signs of a swag drop. They can grow straight up and reach a height of three feet, mind-bogglingly high for a plant with such properties.

But why are they called Snake Plant? Well, they have patterns across their leaves that give the impression of a snake. Moreover, they grow quickly too.

However, you would want them to have medium to bright sunlight and a little water (that when you can manage to get out of bed). Yeah, no pressure.

I wholeheartedly recommend you get the {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/AMERICAN-EXCHANGE-Sansevieria-Zeylanica-Plant/dp/B08FXS9JT3" text="snake plant"%}!

### 7. Agave

Agaves (pronounced 'a-GAH-vee') are from here, the Americas. These have distinct features that make them some of the most striking succulents out there. 

These are mostly in-ground plants that require very low maintenance yet tend to grow quickly. They are fairly large and can develop strong forms - making them easily identifiable.

Okay, take my word when I say that Agaves have some of the largest blooms you'll ever see. We are talking fourteen feet or more. The leaves too are large and have a smooth sword-like shape.

This plant is stunning and I wouldn't be surprised if you purchase it from a {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Agave-Americana-Silver-Giant-Plant/dp/B0055PKQ8Q" text="trusted seller"%}.

## Great Tips to Grow Healthy Succulents Indoors

Although growing the succulents mentioned above is a piece of cake, you might want to consider a few essential tips to take good care of them.

First, {% include link-internal.html link="how-often-to-water-succulents" text="water the succulents" %} enough during summers. If you happen to live in a region that encounters scarce downpours, make sure you water the in-ground succulents at least once every 7-10 days. However, you'd like to reduce the irrigation during winters.

{% include image.html image="infographic-easy-tips.jpg" alt="Three important elements for growing succulents - Water, Soil, and Sun." %}

Next, consult your local suppliers to know what kind of succulents grow the best in your region. Although all the above succulents will grow just fine in any region, you still want to be sure before purchasing one.

Lastly, let these easy-to-care-for beauties have some sun. I mean, just put them out for a few hours every week. Believe me that'll do wonders for them. Otherwise, place them in a windowsill where they get exposed to a consistent level of filtered sunlight.
