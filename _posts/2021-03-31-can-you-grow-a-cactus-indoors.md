## Introduction

Cacti are adored throughout the world because of their forgiving nature. However, since these plants originate from arid regions, you may wonder whether they can be grown indoors or not.

**Cacti can be grown indoors. However, you need to fulfill their needs by providing them with a good sunny spot near a windowsill. Apart from that, you need to give it water every once in a while and keep an eye on it for issues. Fertilize it in the growing season and prune it if there is any pest damage.**

These cacti are very friendly and easily adapt to their surroundings. Christmas cactus can grow very well in partial or diffused sunlight. It is okay to put them in full sunlight in winters, but this is not recommended during summers and spring; because they might turn yellow or pale.

### Temperature Requirements

In this matter, Christmas cacti are choosy. During their growth periods, they need a high temperature between 70◦F to 80◦F. But just after the bud pops out, they require exposure to lower temperatures and a minimum of 13 hours of darkness at night.
			
## 5 Essential Tips to grow a cactus indoors
    
### 1. Color Selection should be made wisely

You know all the spaces where you can possibly place the plant. If you're going to put it in a spot where there are low light conditions, ensure that the cactus plant you get is bright green in color. The brighter the green, the more energy the plant can make through photosynthesis. 

### 2. Set Proper Watering Schedule
            
{% include image.html image="Watering-a-plant.jpg" alt="watering" %}
           
Though most of the cacti live in arid areas, they still need water. So if you buy a cactus, you need to make a schedule for watering it properly.

Since cacti are also succulents, they can last a long time without being watered. They have water stored in their stem, which can last for a decent duration. If left dehydrated for too long, the cactus can turn too pale and dry. During summers, the plant will be in the growing season and should be watered once a week. If you overwater the plant, it can die, so be careful with how you give it hydration!

### 3. Make use of Fertilizers

Regardless of whether you place your cactus outdoors or indoors, fertilizing it is a good idea. Giving it a good fertilizer will help it deal with difficult situations and thrive easily.

### 4. Keep an eye on your Cactus

Please monitor the health of your cactus. You should be able to assess any day-to-day changes that occur in the plant. The better you know your plant, the better care you can provide it.

### 5. Repotting the plant is a must

It might seem that a cactus doesn't need repotting, but the fact is that this should be done after every two to four years. If you fertilize the plant, it will outgrow the pot in 2 years, but if you don't, it can take up to four years!

## Troubleshooting the common cacti problems:

### Problem 1: Diseases

Among the cacti and succulent diseases fungal infections are the most common. It mostly attacks the cacti placed in damp and shady areas where night and day temperature is almost the same. Some common diseases are Corky Scab, Sooty Mold, and Basal Stem Rot.
		
### Brown or white scabs		

These patches are a symbol that there is a pest attack or any carelessness in watering.  You can avoid it by checking your water schedule and swipe the buds with cotton dipped in alcohol.

### Problem 2: Paling

If your cactus began to turn yellow or pale, it indicates that it has been placed in extreme sunlight or high temperature. Therefore, you must remove it from that place as soon as possible.

### Problem 3: Stunted Growth

Similarly, if you notice that your cactus is not growing, that means there is an issue. Maybe something is wrong with the way you water the plant (overwatering or underwatering). Inadequate soil which doesn't have enough nutrients can also be a reason for stunted growth.
		
### Problem 4: Dwindling

Sometimes you may notice that some parts of the cactus start dwindling or become thin and there is abnormal growth in a specific direction. This is a sign that the plant is not getting enough light. You should immediately change the location of your cactus to a spot where there is more sunlight.

### Problem 5: Pests

The most common pests that attack cactus are spider mites, mealy bugs, longhorn beetles and fungus.

You may hardly notice them because they hide in places that are difficult to spot. 	

## How can you control pests?

{% include image.html image="Mealy-bugs.jpg" alt="Mealy bugs" %}

1. Spider mites may be finding the plant because of low humidity and improper ventilation. They can be washed away using a water stream. When you do this, you should cover the soil to avoid overwatering.
2. You can use insecticides like neem or pyrethrins. You should always check whether it is safe for the plant or not before applying it.
3. You should keep newer plants away from the older ones so that pests can't transfer. The new ones can also have a pest that can attack your old cacti. So it is better to quarantine new plants.
4. Provide your plant whatever it needs to thrive. Like humans, a plant with healthy body parts will prosper. Similarly, the plant should have healthy stems, leaves, and roots. You should provide your succulents with a healthy lifestyle with adequate water and light. Doing so will give the plant the strength to fight a pest attack without dying.
5. It would be best to always keep your pots hygienic, so there are no chances for pests to grow. 	
	
## Conclusion

Cacti plants can grow indoors because they have a forgiving nature. They don't need too much water to thrive but require bright indirect light. To keep them at their healthiest inside the home, place them on a sunny windowsill, protect them from pests and fertilize the plant. The healthier your plant, and the better your watering schedule is, the less likely it is that your plant will suffer.
