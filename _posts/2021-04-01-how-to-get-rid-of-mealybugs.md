**Mealybugs are soft white insects that resemble cotton in their appearance. They feed on outdoor and indoor plantations and usually emerge in warm weather. This means you should be on the lookout if you live in a humid area.**

They have a waxy coating and piercing mouthparts which they use to suck fluids from leaves and their stems, taking away vital nutrients from the plants in the process. Also, they produce excess honeydew, which acts as a growing soil for a black-colored fungus called sooty mold.

Some of the species of mealybugs you may encounter on your plants could include vine mealybugs, citrus mealybugs, grape mealybugs, and pineapple mealybugs.

## Ways To Get Rid Of Mealy Bugs 

Mealybugs hide in concealed spots such as stem crevices or the underside of leaves, making them hard to spot. They suck the succulents out of the leaves and stems, making them devoid of essential nutrients, causing stunted growth. 

If you have a garden or you're fond of indoor plantations, you need to be vigilant of any such attacks and treat them instantly. If not, they will spread out rapidly. The first and foremost thing to do when you discover mealybugs is to isolate the plant right away. 

Remember, you don't want the plague to spread out, eventually destroying your entire plantation. There are multiple ways to get rid of mealybugs. 

### 1. Wash The Plant With Some Water

You might want to wash away the mealybugs with a steady stream of water. Use your garden hose to pour water on the infested plants. However, keep in mind that this technique is only useful if there is a slight infestation. You might have to resort to more rigid methods if there has been a full-blown attack. 

### 2. Apply Rubbing Alcohol On Plant

One of the most effective methods we've come across is to rub the infected plants with rubbing alcohol. Note that not every type of alcohol will help you get rid of mealybugs and can have a deleterious effect on the plantations. We recommend using {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Safer-Brand-Insecticidal-Pyrethrin-Concentrate/dp/B00BIDYQCG" text="70% isopropyl alcohol"%} for the best results. 

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Safer Brand Insecticidal Soap & Pyrethrin Concentrate, 32-Ounce" link="https://www.amazon.com/Safer-Brand-Insecticidal-Pyrethrin-Concentrate/dp/B00BIDYQCG" description="I recommend this inseciticidal soap with isoprophyl alcohol as it gives great results when it comes to the elimination of mealybugs!" image="safer-insecticidal-soap-product.jpg" %}

Dip the cotton swabs in alcohol and wipe off all the visible pests on the plant. It would be best if you did this job quite meticulously, though. The pests need to come into direct contact with the alcohol to kill them. To ensure this happens, you have to thoroughly inspect from various angles, underneath the leaf folds and joints to the base of the stem and even the edges of the pot.

Once you've wiped off the foliage, prepare a diluted alcohol solution in a spray bottle and spray it on the entire surface of affected plants. This will make sure the alcohol reaches a considerable area of the plant. 

Keep in mind that you can't get rid of the bugs with just a single application of alcohol. You'll have to repeat the treatment twice a week. 

### 3. Use Insecticidal Soap On Plant

Another simple way to get rid of mealybugs is to spray them with {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Safer-Brand-Insecticidal-Pyrethrin-Concentrate/dp/B00BIDYQCG" text="insecticidal solutions"%}. These can be made using a dish detergent or can readily be found in the market. Make sure you use an insecticidal soap that is suitable for ornamental plants. 

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Safer Brand Insecticidal Soap & Pyrethrin Concentrate, 32-Ounce" link="https://www.amazon.com/Safer-Brand-Insecticidal-Pyrethrin-Concentrate/dp/B00BIDYQCG" description="I recommend this inseciticidal soap as it gives great results when it comes to the elimination of mealybugs!" image="safer-insecticidal-soap-product.jpg" %}

If you prepare a dilute solution yourself, spray it abundantly. The entire plant should be dripping with insecticide. A thoroughly soaked plant with the treatment would give you the most effective results.

You would have to repeat the procedure frequently to get rid of the bugs completely. Refer to the insecticide instructions to make sure you spray an adequate amount without damaging the plant. 

### 4. Using Neem Oil

Do you know that neem oil acts as a natural insecticide and fungicide? In addition to this, it has been declared safe to use on vegetables, fruits, and other edible plants. You can buy a bottle of concentrated {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Dyna-Gro-NEM-008-Neem-Oil/dp/B0012BGXVQ" text="neem oil"%} at cheap rates, and make a dilute mixture. 

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Dyna-Gro NEM-008 Neem Oil, 8 Ounces" link="https://www.amazon.com/Dyna-Gro-NEM-008-Neem-Oil/dp/B0012BGXVQ" description="I wholeheartedly recommend this neem oil product for its effectiveness!" image="neem-oil-product.jpg" %}

Keep spraying the neem oil mixture regularly on the infested plants, reaching deep into the whorls until the bugs disappear entirely. You might find it very daunting and frustrating to reapply the mixture every day. Just don't give up, as the residual effect has a lasting impact.

Dealing with mealybugs that have found their way into your home or garden can undoubtedly be a frustrating experience. But how can you prevent them from building a home in your plants in the first place?

- Monitor the levels of water and fertilizers that you provide to your plants. Keeping the nitrogen levels low reduces the growth of these organisms.
