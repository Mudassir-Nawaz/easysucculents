## INTRODUCTION

Do you intend to propagate your succulents? It is natural to wonder what the best time of the year is to do this task. After all, you want to increase the likelihood of success when it comes to propagation. 

**To successfully propagate your succulents focus your efforts in Spring. Doing this ensures they grow a bit before the harshness of summer sets in. If you’re unable to propagate succulents in summer you can do it in Summers as well. For the rest of the year propagation is not possible.**

## THE BEST SEASONS TO PROPAGATE SUCCULENTS

**The best season to propagate succulents is spring. Most succulents grow in spring, summer, and autumn, and become dormant in winter. It all depends on the succulent you want to propagate and the part of the world you're living in.**

There are winter-dormant succulents and summer-dormant succulents, so it is necessary to first and foremost find out if the succulent you want to propagate is winter or summer dormant. It's possible to be successful in propagating succulents all year round regardless of the season.

The beginning of autumn is the best time to propagate summer-dormant types of succulents like aloe vera and kalanchoe. These succulents start to grow and produce flower buds in autumn, and that is the perfect time to cut and propagate them so the mother plant can have new growth. You can decide to start with aloe vera as it's one of the most versatile succulents. 

Succulents like aeoniums and sedums tend to grow and root quicker and better in autumn, winter, and early spring in more temperate climates where there are no harsh winters. It is safe to propagate aeoniums and sedums throughout winter if there is no danger of frost.

Succulents are drought-tolerant and easy to propagate. They can also tolerate intense exposure to sunlight. Ensure that your succulents are not exposed to rain for long during cold winter months. 

Succulents like echeveria are liable to rot in rainy weather because their leaves are vulnerable to frost damage if you expose them to too much moisture.

## THE BEST CLIMATE TO PROPAGATE SUCCULENTS

Succulents do well in temperate climates. The ideal time to propagate succulents is when the temperature is ranging from 60°F to 80°F. It may not be easy to find the temperature tolerance for all the various succulents out there, but when you know the best temperatures for your succulents, it will help you determine the best time to propagate. 

It's not advisable to propagate succulents when temperatures are lower than 40°F or higher than 90°F, as that isn't the best for succulents. High temperatures and the effect of sun exposure can cause sunburn and damage to the leaves and roots of your succulents.

During summer, if you're living in an area with a warm climate, you should consider planting your succulents directly into the ground instead of in containers. Do this because the temperature of the soil in the ground stays relatively constant despite temperature changes. 

If you must propagate in containers, it is better to avoid glass and metal ones and go for containers made with materials that protect your succulents against sudden fluctuations in temperature.

During winter, always protect your succulents from frost damage by covering them with a cloth or bringing them indoors to keep the temperature above freezing point. Some tropical species like euphorbia and lithops do well in temperatures of 50 to 60°F, while some like sempervivum can tolerate frost of temperatures as low as 30 to 40°F.

Propagating succulents with dry seeds at the beginning of spring to give them time to grow before the dormant season is something you might want to try if you live in a cool or dry climate. To achieve a good result, keep in a warm environment with a temperature of 75ºF to 80ºF to keep the seeds moist and warm.

## THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN PROPAGATING SUCCULENTS FROM LEAVES

{% include image.html image="propagated-succulents1.jpg" alt="Image of propagated succulents in a pot" %}

Propagating succulents from leaves is one of the easiest method of propagation. If you intend to propagate succulents from leaves, there are some vital signs you need to look out for so you know it is the best time to do this, especially if you plan to propagate succulents in winter. You have to be patient with the process, as it may take a little longer time than it would in spring.  You also have to resist every urge to water your leaves.

What to look out for and the best time to propagate succulents from leaves is when the plant develops a long stem at the bottom. When a succulent develops a long woody stem, it is called a leggy plant. When you're ready to propagate, go for the leaves from a leggy plant and always choose the healthy leaves from the bottom and leave the younger and smaller growth near the top.

Gently remove the leaves from the stem with your fingers and place them in a warm place with indirect sunlight and let it dry.  Please, do not place the leaves in the soil until the wound at the spot it was removed from the stem heals.

## CONCLUSION

Propagating succulents can be done all year round, but you'll be sure of the best results during the spring and summer seasons when succulents are actively growing.  

You can also propagate succulents all year round if you propagate indoors in a place where the temperatures are always favorable for succulents as they hardly go into a dormancy period depending on where you live.
