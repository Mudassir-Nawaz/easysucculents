faq: 
- question: Why should succulent soil have good drainage? 
  answer: Succulents don't grow well in overly moist soil and requires excellent drainage. The plant already saves a lot of water in its stems, stalks and leaves. Therefore, you should ensure your soil mix has proper drainage.
- question: Is it better to make a succulent soil mix or buy a readmymade one?
  answer: It is best if you make your own soil mix. However, if you do research and find a suitable soil mix, you can use that as well.
- question: What happens if the succulent soil mix has poor drainage? 
  answer: Poor draining in a succulent's soil will lead to inevitable root rot. The plant detests soggy soil and can even die if it gets waterlogged.

### Sand

Simple sand is beneficial for succulents as it makes the soil lighter. In other words, if you think the soil is too compact, you can add sand to make it less dense. Apart from that, sand also helps with drainage by adding a grittiness to the soil. When you're dealing with succulents, you want the soil to have good drainage capabilities.

### Garden Soil

Garden soil has an average pH, which is very important for the wellbeing of succulents. It also helps with drainage. Unlike sand, it gives essential nutrients to the soil mix and makes it nutritious for the plant. Garden soil enhances the composition and texture of bare soil.  Therefore, it is a necessary ingredient that you must include in the soil mix.

### Pumice

Pumice is one of the most used soil ingredients for succulents. Lava rock, when crushed, becomes pumice which acts as a great binding agent for the soil. Pumice has good moisture retention. The tiny pores of pumice store nutrients and moisture for an extended period. It is a pure organic product that helps maintains healthy succulent soil.

## What Qualities Should the Succulent Soil Mix Have?

**The perfect succulent soil mix should permit excellent drainage and be breathable. Moreover, it should also be nutritious enough for the plant's wellbeing.**

### Succulent Soil Should Have Good Drainage

The soil mix should ideally have excellent drainage. If the soil retains too much moisture, it can cause root rot. Please remember that succulents don't need overly moist soil. However, it won't like excessively dry soil either. The perfect succulent soil mix drains well enough to allow the soil to remain damp but not soggy. 

### The Succulent Soil Mix Should Be Breathable

Please stick to the recipe we suggest and don't alter the ratio. If you add too much or too little of the ingredients, you may impact the soil's density making it too compact or too light. You should know that compact soil is toxic to succulents, as the plant finds it hard to breathe in it. The soil mix must be breathable, or else the plant will suffer. 

### Potting Mixture Should Be Nutritious

Mixing too little of an amount of garden soil can make your soil mixture less nutritious than necessary. A non-nutritious or even a less healthy soil mixture will not provide enough energy and strength to the succulents as they require. Compromising on the quality of the garden soil will result in poor growth in the succulent.

## What Equipment is Needed To Prepare Succulent Soil?

**To prepare a succulent mix, you need to have a pair of gloves, a bucket to mix the soil in, a stirrer to mix the ingredients, and a measuring jar. The gloves will help keep your hands clean, the bucket and stirrer will help mix the soil, and the measuring jar will help you get the ratio right!**

## What is The Importance of Succulent Soil?

**A high-quality soil mix is vital for the health of a succulent. Since succulents are typically from arid areas, the soil needs to have good drainage capabilities. The soil should at most be slightly damp but should never be soggy or excessively dry.** 

Succulents store water in their leaves, stems and stalks. Therefore, they do not need overly moist soil. In fact, soil that is too soggy can cause root rot and kill the plant. Please be kind to your plant if you want to see it flourish.
