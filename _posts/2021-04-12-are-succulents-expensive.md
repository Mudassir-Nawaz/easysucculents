## Introduction

Succulents are stunning plants that hold water in different structures, like leaves and stalks. Although they primarily originate from the desert, they are trending as décor due to their tolerant nature. You may want to get one, but you're wondering whether they are expensive to get.

**Generally, succulents are not expensive. However, the rarer a succulent is, the more you have to pay for it. It won't be too difficult to purchase a common succulent at an economical price from the local nursery or a reputable online store.**

##  What are the factors that may make a succulent expensive?

**The factors that can make a succulent expensive include the succulent's rarity, the maintenance cost, the medicinal properties, and the aesthetic value associated with it.**

### 1. Rarity of Succulent

When a succulent is extremely rare, it will be costly to purchase. Since there are not many shops that sell succulents in the USA, there is little competition among sellers. If a succulent is scarce, it can be sold for a higher price for a profit.

### 2. High maintenance cost

Sometimes, succulents can take a lot of time to grow. The longer it takes for a plant to grow, the more financial resources and energy are used on it. The plant may need more pruning and feeding too. These factors can cause a higher price for the succulent.

### 3. Aesthetic Value of The Succulent

If a succulent has a stunning appearance that can enhance the look of a room, it may be more expensive. These tolerant plants can be very striking and attractive, making them ideal for use as décor. If a  succulent is trending due to its aesthetic value, it may fetch a higher price in the market due to higher demand.

### 4. Medicinal importance

Few variants of succulents such as Salão, Yucca, and {% include link-authority.html link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411014000078" text="Aloe Vera have medicinal value" %}.

Succulents, like other plants, release oxygen and make the air clean for us. Since they are so popular, some species have become endangered. These rare succulents are expensive due to their perceived scarcity.

## 2. Does the size of succulents make them expensive?

{% include image.html image="echeveria- succulent.jpg" alt="different succulent plants in pots with different sizes and shapes" %}

Generally, the bigger and broader the plant, the costlier it is. A smaller plant will be cheaper than the larger one. 

Since larger plants take up a lot of space and are usually slow-growing, it can take a while for them to mature. They require more care and maintenance, which also bumps up the price.

## 3. Does the locality affect the cost of succulents?

Most succulents need bright indirect light, which isn't too difficult to achieve indoors. All you must do is place them near a windowsill, and you're good to go. Moreover, they require little maintenance if correctly potted. These plants thrive with little care and are highly adaptable, so it is easy to conclude that the locality doesn't impact the cost of succulents. 

## 4. How do dynamics of supply and demand make succulents expensive?

It would be wise for you to realize that there are countless types of succulents, some of which have a higher demand than the rest. Aloe Vera plants, cacti, and orchids are just some examples. Aloe Vera and agave plants have been adored for their {% include link-authority.html link="https://search.proquest.com/openview/f166fcb4c2b54e72a035978b74b61709/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2044945" text="antiseptic properties" %}. Other cacti species are also traditionally consumed as part of their diet in some cultures.
