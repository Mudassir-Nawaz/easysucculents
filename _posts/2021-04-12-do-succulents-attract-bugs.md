## Introduction

Succulents have taken the world by storm. They've managed to become the favorite plant in everyone's garden. Some people think that they are pest-resistant. However, is that even true? Asking whether succulents attract bugs is a good idea.

**Yes, succulents can attract bugs. While it is true that succulents are pest-resistant, they still manage to attract bugs. Since these plants have high water concentrations, they attract predators who want to feast on them to get hydrated.**

## What Bugs Are Attracted To Succulents?

**Bugs that are commonly attracted to succulents include Mealybugs, Aphids, Scales, Ants, Gnats, Spider mites.**

Let's discuss all of them one by one:
 
### 1. Mealybugs

Mealybugs can destroy your succulent in the blink of an eye. They suck the plant of its vitality by stealing water. As a result, your plant will become wrinkled and weak, ultimately leading to its death.

These bugs are white and cotton-like in appearance and don't look like bugs. Are you wondering how you can identify them on your succulents?

Well, you can expect to find them on the growing parts of the plants. For instance, you will see them on the base of the stem or the leaves.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Examine your succulents regularly" content="Examine your succulents regularly. This will help you identify mealybugs as soon as possible. Thus, you can take some corrective measures instantly." %}

### 2. Aphids

Another bug that can destroy your succulent is called Aphid. These bugs tend to be found in large numbers and can hence be quite problematic. They cause damage by sucking the succulent's stems and leaves. Apart from that, aphids also produce a sticky substance that makes the succulent susceptible to mold.

If you're not careful with identifying aphids early on, you risk losing the plant and spreading the bug to other neighboring plants. This is why it is vital to locate and remove aphids as soon as possible.

Detecting aphids won't be too tricky. Just look out for the following things:

- A trail of ants coming from your plant indicates the presence of aphids.
- A sooty mold on the plant indicates that Aphids are there.

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Detect Aphids as soon as possible" content="If you don't detect the Aphids as soon as possible, the Aphids will grow uncontrollably. And you would not be able to treat such a heavy manifestation. As a result, you've to lose your favorite plant." %}

### 3. Scales

Scales are similar to mealy bugs. A plant affected by them will have small brown domes hovering on it. Luckily, you can scrape them from the leaves without much ado.

The scales primarily consume the succulent's sap. Consequently, your succulent may suffer a lot.

Scales try to trick you with their appearance. You might think that the brown spot on your succulents is the scales. But, in reality, these are the shields of the scales.

To confirm whether your plant is affected by scales, look out for brown spots on your plant.

### 4. Ants

Ants are the insects that are most abundant in nature. They usually are harmless. And you might think they are harmless to succulents as well, right? However, if you see an army of ants marching from your succulent, it's something to worry about.

So, the question is, why should you be worried? Well, these ants are an indication that your plant has an aphid or a mealybug infestation. Both of these bugs secrete sticky substances that attract ants.

### 5. Gnats

Fungus gnats are not as harmful as other pests can be to your plants. But, you may feel irritated to see them. They look much like mosquitos and give a creepy look to your plants.

Apart from that, a large number of gnats can cause the plant to lose its shiny appearance. Who wants to be left with dull leaves that won't shine?

### 6. Spider mites

Spider mites are another harmful pest for succulents. Besides weakening the plants, they make your plant prone to other infections.

Some simple signs can help you spot spider mites. The first one to look out for is the appearance of small white webs, and the second is small brown or rust-colored dots on the plant.

Now the question is, how can these bugs damage your succulents? Well, they inject a chemical into the plant tissue. This chemical leads to irreversible damage and abnormal growth in the succulent. As a result, you have no other option than to discard your beloved plant.

It is a good idea to take preventive measures to keep bugs away from succulents. After all, they can attract them. 

Follow these tips if you want to {% include link-authority.html link="https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/" text="prevent bugs" %} from living on your succulent:

## How to Remove Bugs From Succulents?

**To remove bugs from succulents, firstly you should remove any highly damaged parts of the plant. Apart from that, you can promote plant hygiene by using soapy water or rubbing alcohol to rid the plant of bugs.**

However, if you read up a bit about what you need to do, the task will become way easier. 

I am sure you don't have to discard your entire plant if you apply these methods carefully. 

### 1. Remove the damaged part

Just imagine you find a bug on a specific part of your succulent. What will you do first? In my opinion, you should consider removing that particular part.

Just remove the part that is infested with bugs. This will prevent the bug from spreading to other parts of the plant. And ultimately, you will save the entire succulent from damage. 

This method can be used for any bug that can adversely affect succulents, such as scales or mealybugs.

### 2. Use Rubbing alcohol

Have you removed the damaged part of the plant? If you did, and you're still struggling with bugs, I have another solution for you.

Take {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Isopropyl-Alcohol-Antiseptic/dp/B07NFTZ522" text="rubbing alcohol"%}. Dip a little cotton in the rubbing alcohol and use it to rub the infected part gently. And hopefully, this will result in leaving no insect on your plant.

However, this method will not work if your plant is severely infested with bugs.
