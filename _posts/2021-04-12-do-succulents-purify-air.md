faq: 
- question: Do succulents clean the air indoors?
  answer: Growing succulents indoors will purify your air quality by cleaning and removing toxins, i.e., Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The plant increases oxygen levels and reduces carbon dioxide. It also filters the toxicants. The filtered toxic is then pulled into the soil and used by root to create food for the plant.
- question: What are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and why are they harmful?  
  answer: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are the toxic compounds in your air emitted from certain products or specific processes such as burning fuel. The byproducts are formaldehyde, benzene, xylene, etc. Exposure to VOCs can result in nausea, sore throat, headaches, itchy eyes and eventually even cancer.
- question: Can you remove harmful toxins with succulents?
  answer: Succulents absorb Volatile Organic Compounds from your indoor air and recycle them. They achieve this with help of their own parts like (leaves and root) and with the help of organisms present in the soil. The plant later converts toxins into nutrients for the plants. The bioremediation process occurs to clean pollutants in the air.  
- question: How many plants does it take to purify the air in a room?
  answer: The NASA research done in 1989 on indoor air pollution suggests that the placement of 15 to 18 succulents in 6 to 8 inch diameter pots can purify the air in an average 1,800 square foot home. That is a succulent plant in every 100 square feet of floor space for effective air purification.  
- question: Can the jade plant purify the air?
  answer: Jade Plant, also referred to as Crassula Ovata, is another succulent that is perfect for cleaning your indoor air. Jade plant doesn't just appeal to you visually. It is also a catalyst for cleansing your air. It does that by effectively removing and absorbing toxins from the air.  
- question: How do snake plants purify the air?
  answer: The Snake plant is another excellent plant that will clean and purify your air by absorbing toxins pollutants via its leaves. At the same time, it converts carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen during the night. It is an excellent plant that can be placed by your bedside because of its ability to convert CO2 to O2.

## Introduction

Do you wish to purify the air in your home? Household Air Pollution (HAP) is now one of the most critical public health risk, with over 90% of people spending most of their time in an indoor environment.

**Succulents can purify the air by removing toxins present in the atmosphere. Succulents that can do this includes the Jade plant, the Snake plant, Dracaena ‘JANET Craig’, Red-Edged Dracaena (Dracaena Marginate) and ‘Warneckii (Dracaena Fragrans).**

## Can Succulent Plants Purify Your Indoor Air?

**Growing succulents indoors will purify your air quality by cleaning and removing toxins, i.e., Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). The plant increases oxygen levels and reduces carbon dioxide. It also filters toxins which are later trapped into the soil and converted as food for the plant.**

## The 7 Best Air-Purifiying Succulents

Based on research, the Snake plant and the Aloe vera plant are the best air purifying succulents. 

Here is the list of excellent succulents that are great at purifying air quality.  

### 1. Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis) 

**Aloe vera improves air quality because of its wonderful nature. Aloe removes 90% of formaldehyde with other VOCs and converts them into nutrients. This is why it is in the NASA's list of best air purifying plants.**  

**Recommendation and Care:** Aloe Vera is one of the most popular succulents and it will need to be watered but not too often. Always let the top third of the potting soil to dry out before watering the houseplant. It will also thrive in a sunny location.

## How Many Plants You Need to Clean Your Indoor Air

**The NASA research done in 1989 on indoor air pollution recommends 15 to 18 succulents plants in 6 to 8-inch diameter pot to clean and purify the air in an average 1,800 square foot home. That is a succulent plant in every 100 square feet of floor space for effective air purification.**

Bill Wolverton, the NASA scientist that conducted this study, suggested an idea of what to look out for in a succulent for effective air purification. They stated that the leafier and more giant the plant, the better because the leaves' surface will influence the air purification.  

You may need multiple species of succulents to purify your indoor air. It is also crucial to test how suitable the chosen succulent is for your home before embarking on this project.  

Another research and study funded by the {% include link-authority.html link=" https://www.horticulture.com.au/hort-innovation/news-events/one-indoor-plant-can-combat-sickness-study-finds/" text="Hort Innovation Australia" %} concluded that one Succulent in a room (i.e., roughly 4 meters by 5 meters room, and or 13 by 16 feet); will bring about an improvement in air quality by 25%.  They recommended that placing more succulents in a room will further improve the air quality.

## Harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in The Air
 
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are the toxic compounds in your air emitted from products or processes such as burning fuel. The byproducts are formaldehyde, benzene, Xylene, etc. Exposure to these gases can result in nausea, sore throat, headaches, itchy eyes and eventually cause cancer.

There are abundant sources of toxins in the home which disturb the air quality. According to the {% include link-authority.html link="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/household-air-pollution-and-health" text="World Health Organization" %}, 3.8 million people die prematurely every year from illness associated with household air pollution.

Sources of Volatile Organic Compounds at home or in your offices are printers, shopping bags, detergent, paint, paper towels, glue, tissues, cigarette smoke, books, cleaning products, photocopiers, and printer ink.

{% include link-authority.html link=" https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality" text="Research" %} has shown that the level of Volatile Organic Compounds found in homes can be 2 to 5 times greater than that found outdoors. In some cases, the level of VOC gases indoors is ten times that which is outdoors.

Pollutants can take a long time to disperse from indoor air. This is why you need succulents to continue to help you clean and purifying your indoor air.

Signs and symptoms that are related to exposure to Volatile Organic Compounds include:

- Fatigue
- Allergic skin reaction
- Dizziness
- Eye and respiratory tract irritation
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Visual disorders and memory impairment

## NASA Clean Air Study Project

The theory of using Succulents to purify air was first studied a long time ago at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA and Associated Landscape Contractors of America (ALCA) {% include link-authority.html link="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930073077" text="Clean Air Study project" %}. It aimed to study ways to purify the air in space stations for future long-term space habitation.  

Their findings suggest that through photosynthesis the plant absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen back to the air. 

The result showed that purer air was achieved by placing a plant every 100 square feet (9.3 m2) of gap or space (though the experiment was conducted under sealed conditions).  

The study noted that though most plants are beneficial, some specific plants (i.e., succulents) are more effective at cleaning and purifying the polluted air.

## How to Remove Harmful Toxins with Succulents?

**Succulents absorb Volatile Organic Compounds from the indoor air. The plant later converts toxins to nutrients for the plants. The succulents use the bioremediation process to clean the air.**

According to NASA, succulents can clean and purify 87% of the volatile organic compounds present in indoor air within 24 hours. It is because they can continue to keep exhaling oxygen even when you turn off their light at night.  

## Conclusion  

The famous Nasa studies and experiments published in 1989 have shown succulents to be great air purifiers. They need little sunlight, and can photosynthesize even in the night. They purify, clean, and convert harmful VOCs in the air to nutrients.  

But do all succulents purify the air? Any succulent will help improve your indoor air quality. However, if you had to pick two, perhaps Aloe Vera and Snake plant would be best for your home.
