## Introduction

Effective water cooling is essential for a hydroponic system, and so you must invest in a good water chiller. There are many different types of water chillers available on the market today, so it can be overwhelming to figure out which type will work best for you.

**To choose the best hydroponic chiller, you must consider factors like the machine's horsepower, the material used in the components, and the capacity.  Since the chiller should be suitable for the intended reservoir, its capacity must be considered.**

## What Does Hydroponics Mean?

In the simplest terms, hydroponics is the cultivation of plants without soil. To cultivate a plant through this method, the plant is placed in water regularly refreshed and enriched with liquid fertilizer. It is possible to grow plants in this water which has sufficient nutrients to nourish the plant and keep it healthy.

In short, it is the cultivation of plants in water. The etymology of the word hydroponics is found in the ancient Greek: "hydro" or water and "ponos" or work. In essence, the word hydroponics emphasizes the usefulness and functionality of the water used in this cultivation method. 

## What Is Hydroponic Water Chiller?

{% include image.html image="hydroponic water chiller.jpg" alt="hydroponic water chiller" %}

The hydroponic water chiller uses refrigerant gas to cool the water that passes inside them. They are a little noisy and come with a controller that lets you set the desired temperature for the system. 

Water chillers maintain the desired temperature in hydroponic systems. They prove to be very effective in cooling the water in the tank.

## When Is It Appropriate To Use A Hydroponic Water Chiller?

When it is too hot in summer, it is a challenging time for hydroponic growers. The higher the temperature, the lesser the oxygen residue in the nutrient solution. Since this can be bad news for your plant, it is something to be concerned about. In summer, when the temperature reaches between 30° C and 40° C, your hydroponic plants may suffer. 

With high temperatures and little oxygen available, the roots begin to deteriorate, and in a short time, pathogenic organisms such as fungi and aggressive parasites develop. 

We believe that the water should ideally be between a temperature of 15° C and 23° C. If a harsh summer is expected, there are several things you can do to cool the water for the plant. In this article, we will guide how to choose the best water chiller for hydroponics. 

## What Is The Optimal Water Temperature For Growing Plants With Hydroponics?

{% include image.html image="burning hydroponic example.jpg" alt="burning hydroponic example" %}

The oxygen levels of the water and the temperature level are crucial parameters that you must keep an eye on.

Indeed, hydroponics works because the water contains dissolved oxygen. But the higher the temperature, the lesser dissolved oxygen is present in the solution. In summer, when the temperatures rise between 30° C and 40° C,  the water's oxygen levels plummet substantially. So you have to do something about it for your plant's health.

With high temperature and little oxygen, the plant's roots will deteriorate, and diseases will develop. These are ideal conditions for insects and pathogenic fungi. Such predators appreciate weakened plants which no longer have the strength to defend themselves. If you don't react quickly or don't know what to do, you can lose your plant entirely.

The solution is purchasing a hydroponic water chiller!

## How To Choose The Best Water Chiller For Hydroponics？

To choose the best water chiller for a hydroponic system, you need to check the product on certain parameters

### Ensure Superior Quality of Water Chiller Components

The hydroponic chiller consists of 4 main components: compressor, evaporator, condenser, and valve expansion. The quality of these components plays a vital role in the efficiency of the cooling, electricity consumption, and resistance of the chiller.

A good water chiller consists of a branded compressor for fast cooling and a platinum evaporator to handle saltwater.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro Tip:" subtitle="Buy an original water chiller" content="Whenever purchasing any machinery, ensure that you are not buying a copy. Only purchase an original water chiller from reliable sellers to avoid any misfortune. " %}

### Check the Horsepower Of Water Chiller

The horsepower of a water chiller has a significant impact on the cooling capacity! If the horsepower is too little, you might end up harming your chiller over time. If the horsepower is too much, it will use high amounts of electricity, causing a significant expense.

Hence, horsepower plays an essential role and is a factor you must consider before buying a hydroponic system chiller.

### Don't Compromise on the Budget

Don't compromise on the budget as it is better to spend a bit more now than regret later on. There are some inferior water chillers available in the market, and they will waste your time. Instead, I recommend you keep a reasonable budget while purchasing the chiller. The aim is to buy the best chiller that is within your pocket's reach.

{% include warning.html title="Warning:" subtitle="Don't buy an inferior water chiller" content=" Don't go for a cheap water chiller as it may cost you more in the long run than what you would save now." %} 

### Consider the Size Of the Hydroponic Reservoir

Find the water chiller according to the size of your hydroponic reservoir. It is impossible to purchase a good water chiller without considering your needs. If the reservoir is too large, the machine you are buying needs to have enough cooling capacity. Therefore, consider this factor before you finalize your purchase. 
 
## To Sum Up

In hydroponic systems, plants grow without soil in water. In regions with harsh summers, a water chiller can help maintain the right temperature for the system. To choose the best hydroponic water chiller, you must consider factors like the cooling capacity, horsepower, and the quality of the components used.
