## What are Terrariums?

Succulents are a delight to raise. Since they usually need a bit of light and little water, they're easy to grow. However, even raising succulents requires proper care and attention from you. This is where terrariums can help. But are they worth it?

**Terrariums are glass containers that can provide easy growth for succulents and other plants. Control of moisture, humidity and cleaning is key for the plants to grow well in these glass containers.**

## What Type of Terrarium is Good for Succulents?

**Terrariums are glass containers made for different plants. But not all terrariums can suit your succulents. You can either choose open terrariums or closed terrariums. For succulents, open terrariums are your best bet.**

Here is how both of the terrariums are different!

|                  	| Open Terrariums                                                                                     	| Closed Terrariums                                                                        	|
|------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Air Circulation  	| No problem for air to go through.                                                                   	| You need to open it for around 15 minutes, at least once a month.                        	|
| Sunlight         	| Sunlight can reach the plant directly.                                                              	| Sunlight reaches the plant through the glass.                                            	|
| Types of Plants  	| Good for plants that need a lot of air and a dry environment.                                       	| Good for plants that need less air and more moisture.                                    	|
| Watering         	| Require a lot of watering since there is no condensation. They also don't have a lid to cover them. 	| Plants in closed terrariums don't need a lot of water because of a condensed atmosphere. 	|
| Layering of Soil 	| Open terrariums need pebbles along with soil, charcoal and rocks.                                   	| Closed terrariums don't need pebbles.                                                    	|

## How Do You Manage Terrariums?

**Although terrariums are small, they need maintenance. Managing both open and closed terrariums can be a bit different. Open terrariums need less upkeep as compared to closed terrariums.**

### 1. Tips for Maintaining Open Terrariums

{% include image.html image="open-terrarium.jpg" alt="An open terrarium with succulents and soil layers" %}

- They are open to pests. You will have to treat every insect attack differently!
- Some plants can grow out of open terrariums. This can require frequent trimming.
- You should water only a few times in a couple of weeks.

If you don't have an open terrarium at your place, I think I know where you might want to get one. Check out this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/WGV-Hanging-Votive-Candle-Terrarium/dp/B00OFY9WRO" text="link"%} which I recommend!

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="" content="If you don't remove dying succulents and dead leaves, they can infect other plants in the terrarium!" %}

### Tips for Maintaining Closed Terrariums

{% include image.html image="closed-terrarium.jpg" alt="A closed terrarium with a tiny plant" %}

- Closed terrariums can have more moss. It may look great, but it can also harm your plants.
- Keep closed terrariums away from a lot of heat pressure.
- Do not overwater closed terrariums because it will cause too much humidity.

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="" content="Remember to often check in on the humidity of a closed terrarium." %}

## What Type of Plants Can You Have in Terrariums?

Since terrariums are small glass containers, you need plants that are tiny too.

### Plants for Open Terrariums

Plants that need dryness are the best choice for open terrariums. So they can make a great home for your succulents!

Depending on where you place your open terrarium, you can have two types of succulents.

- **Succulents that need sunshine directly**

Plants such as aloe vera, sedum, and echeveria (purple cactus) need great exposure to sunshine to survive. Please place them in an open terrarium at the windowsill, and you'll be good to go!

- **Succulents that don't need sunshine directly**

Cactii and other plants that have darker colours can be kept in shady places.

Have a look at some popular succulent plants.

{% include featured-post.html post="most-popular-succulents" %}

### Plants for Closed Terrariums

The type of plants that grow well in closed terrariums is those that like shade.

- Ferns
- Pyrrosia
- Delia
- Asplenium
- Neoregelia
- Cryptanthus

You should avoid keeping succulents in closed terrariums. Too much humidity will hinder the growth of succulents.

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="" content="Open terrariums are more suitable for succulents due to greater airflow." %}

## How Do You Layer Your Terrarium Soil?

**To layer the soil of your terrarium, you would need soil, moss, gravel, and charcoal. Since you get to see the layers, the chances of mistakes are very low!**

Let's have a look at all the layers from top to bottom.

{% include image.html image="terrarium-soil-layers.jpg" alt="A closed terrarium with soil layers" %}

### 1. Top Layer
You can use reindeer moss as a decorative layer on the top.

### 2. Second Layer
The soil you choose will depend upon your succulent. Read up more about the soil you need on {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-choose-soil-for-your-cactus" text="' How to select soil for your cactus'" %}.

### 3. Third Layer
You can use clumpy or carpeting mosses for this layer. Doing so will add flair to your terrarium. 

### 4. Fourth Layer
You can have rocks in this layer. River rocks known called pea gravels are usually the best choice.

### 5. Fifth (Base) Layer
The most important layer of them all! It will help if you use activated charcoal as your base. After all, it will keep the odour away and also let the water drain properly!

## How Do You Take Care of Succulents in Terrariums?

**Good watering, soil, and light can keep your succulents healthy and growing well in terrariums. You will need to set a timeline for proper care!**

- Watering
Too much water can cause your succulent to die. To manage this, you can either go for terrariums with drainage holes. Or keep your watering minimum after every couple of weeks.

- Soil
The soil needs to be spread over stones and needs to be gritty too. Regular soil won't help with drainage, and sooner or later, your succulent will rot!

- Light
Your succulents will need some direct sunshine for a few hours. You can place them at the windowsill.
