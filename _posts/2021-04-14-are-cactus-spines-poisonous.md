## Are Cactus Spines Poisonous?

Many of us have had an encounter with the tiny needle-like spines laced on the skin of a cactus. I remember getting pricked by one in my garden. I was highly concerned. What if it was poisonous? I was confused about the severity of the issue and was wondering what I should do ahead.

**Cactus spines are not poisonous, although they can hurt. They can cause pain, but it takes little to no time for the minor injuries to heal. On the other hand, if a spine is left inside the skin, it can cause a bacterial or fungal infection. If this happens, you may face inflammation and irritation on your skin.**

## Why are there spines on a Cactus?

**The spines protect cacti against both wild animals and the scorching desert heat. They play a vital role in camouflage, water collection, prevention of evaporation, and production of offspring.**

### 1. Cactus Spines Keep Animals Away 

Most animals search for food and water to survive in the arid climate of the desert. Cacti has a 90% to 94% water concentration that attracts animals like quail, kangaroo rats, sheep, and tortoises. The spines help by keeping animals away. 

### 2. Cactus Spines Prevent Evaporation

The various spines stand close together to make clusters on the cacti skin. These clusters work together to provide shade to the succulent and act as a barrier that prevents evaporation.

### 3. Cactus Spines Aid Water Collection

If water droplets fall at the tip of the spine due to either fog or rain, the spine redirects them. The water droplets will then glide down to the roots. The roots absorb this water and store it for the tougher days ahead.

### 4. Cactus Spines Help Deal With Air Flow

More water loss occurs in the desert areas due to the intense airflow. The spine needles act as a cushion between the air and the cacti surface to moderate water loss. 

### 5. Cactus Spines Are Crucial for Camouflage

Cactus spines come in all shades, colours, sizes, and textures to better camouflage with their surroundings. Why is this important? If a cactus can blend in with the background, it can save itself from becoming prey to another animal!

### 6. Specific Cactus Spines Actually Aid Propagation

The glochids or barbed bristles on the spine are the seed of the cactus. They can fly away from the plant, leading to the creation of offspring. Animals also act as a vector and help cacti expand their family. Therefore, spines are important to aid the propagation of cacti.

While a spine pricking you shouldn't cause too much worry; what to do if you trip on a cactus? There is a chance that some ended up piercing you in sensitive areas of the body. You should be worried, especially if glochids, tiny hair-like spines are involved. After contact with these glochids, rubbing your eyes can be dangerous.

The impact can be serious, depending on the severity of the injury. Ruptures act as a pathway to both bacterial and fungal infections. Taking extra precautions is best for your safety.

## What To Do If Pricked?

**If it was just a prick and no needles broke, you must clean the area with soap and water. Then you may apply a bandage if you believe it is needed. However, if a spine is stuck in your skin, you have to remove it. If you can't remove the cactus spine yourself and the pain is unbearable, rush to a hospital.**

{% include image.html image="if-you-get-pricked.jpg" alt="Cactus Prick Care" %}

If a piece of the spine is stuck in your skin, you are advised to remove it as soon as possible using tweezers carefully. If you are unable to remove it, soak the area in warm water and try again. 

Another technique to remove the spines involves using duct tape. Place the duct tape right on top of the spine and press it using your hands. Once the adhesive is stuck to the spine, you can remove the tape by pulling it quickly.

{% include warning.html title="Be Careful!" content="Do not scratch the affected area. It is a recipe for disaster and things might get worse." %}

## When is Medical Help Required?

**If you believe that the contact that injured you has contact with pesticides recently, you should rush to the hospital. If the pain is too unbearable and you can't remove the spine, rush to a medical centre.**

Did you fall on a cactus that recently had contact with pesticides? Are you unable to remove the spine no matter what you do? Is the affected area swollen with a rash? Don't waste any time and consult a doctor.

The contact of pesticides with injuries can be extremely harmful. You don't want hazardous chemicals to enter your body through the rupture, which is likely to happen if the cactus was treated with them. The chemical composition can lead to irritation and severe allergic reactions. If you believe your injury was caused by a plant treated with pesticide, get examined to avoid complications.

You plucked out the spine; if burning and discomfort begin, this might cause cysts that leave behind black spots. Similarly, if the glochid finds its way to your eyes or throat, you may be in trouble. Get medical help as quickly as possible.
