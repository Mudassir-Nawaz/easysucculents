## What's This Post About?

Are you contemplating whether grow lights are good for your succulents? If yes, then the probability is high that your plants are not receiving enough sunlight. This could be because your window sill is too cluttered or perhaps, the winter season isn't treating your succulents right, causing them to etiolate and lose their natural vigor.

Your concern is right as there are chances of your plants gradually becoming pale and enfeebled. We've put together everything you need to know about how to use grow lights so that you can take better care of your succulents.

**Grow lights can help stimulate the growth of your succulents when they are unable to get access to adequate sunlight. Simply adding a source of grow light that gives out the right intensity of light can significantly enrich your plants' growth, making the succulents healthy and full of life.**

## What Are Grow Lights?

Grow lights are artificial sources of light, generally used as substitutes for sunlight, to provide sufficient light to the plants for their healthy growth. 

Powered by electricity, grow lights provide a similar spectrum to sunlight. They prove to be beneficial for the plants that cannot depend on natural sunlight, usually due to unfavorable weather conditions, such as extreme winters or monsoons. In many cases, grow lights are placed indoors for the plants growing inside where adequate sunlight cannot reach them.

## Do You Need Grow Lights For Succulents?

A fundamental concern that many plant owners have is whether they really need grow lights for their succulents. We know that succulents do not require a high intensity of sunlight, then what raises the need for grow lights? 

You may have noticed some of your most exotic succulents placed indoors in the corner, away from direct sunlight, gradually losing their vibrant colors, and their leaves slowly elongating and stretching out.

Or the winter season, with its shorter days and longer nights having a {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-prepare-your-succulents-for-winter" text="harsh impact on your succulents" %} , making them pale and etiolated.  Well, that is because they have been deprived of an essential resource vital for their growth. These beautiful and sun-loving plants need some form of light to maintain their enchanting charm.

Here is our special post that can help you better prepare your succulents for winters:

## Types of Grow Lights

{% include image.html image="grow-light-types-custom-infographic.jpg" alt="infograph listing grow light types" %}

When choosing which type of grow light to use, you'll have to sort through several variables, ranging from the type of light, the color of light, the intensity of light, and so on. Of course, your selection would depend on the most efficient and cheap alternatives available. 

### 1. Fluorescent Grow Light Tubes

One of the most common types of grow lights is tube lights. Available in a range of sizes, from T5, T8, T12, varying in diameter, they can be used as efficient supplements of light for plants. 

We recommend using T5 as they are more energy-efficient, last for a longer duration, and produce more light among all the options available. 

Simply set up one or more tube lights on top of your plants to enhance their growth. They are probably an ideal option for providing light to a substantial collection of succulents. 

Here is a brilliant and reliable option you can explore for {% include link-amazon.html link=" https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Fluorescent-Light-Starting-Growing/dp/B018WIOBXS" text="fluorescent grow light"%}:

### 2. CFL Lights

The compact fluorescent lights are a much more efficient source of light. Better than what may seem to be old-fashioned, elongated tubes of light, these compact grow bulbs can be inserted in any socket and tend to last for around 10000 hours. 

These bulbs also have varying levels of temperatures, wattages, and base types, so carry out your research properly before installing any of these sources for your plants. Keep in mind that these fluorescent light bulbs emit much greater heat, so be sure to place them at a distance from the plants to prevent the risk of accidentally burning them.

Here is an affordable option of {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-93101230-Balanced-Spectrum/dp/B07NN6SVG6" text="CFL light"%} that you can use for your plants.

### 3. LED Grow Lamps

Did you know that from the broad spectrum of light rays that the plants receive, they majorly utilize red and blue light rays? Similar is the case with succulents. With the LED grow lamps, you have the opportunity to give your plants the specific rays of light that they require.

With a lifespan of almost 50000 hours, you do not have to worry about replacing these lights frequently. In comparison to CFL, they tend to be much more energy-efficient, as these LEDs emit relatively less volume of heat.

However, LED grow lights may not be the perfect option for your succulents as they often have lower light intensity and power. The choice of such a grow light would entirely depend on your research and plantation area, which needs to be lit. 

Here is an option you can explore for buying {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Spectrum-Indoor-Plants-Flower/dp/B00FACY7SO" text="LED grow lights"%}:

Since we've looked at the various grow light options available, choose wisely depending on the number of succulents you have and the area occupied by them.

## How to Use Grow Lights?

It is finally time to set up your grow lights. To begin with, find the perfect spot in the house where you would want to place your succulents.

### 1. Distance

The distance between the grow lights from the plants is quite important to make sure they do the job just right. Placing the lights too far would not provide sufficient light to your succulents to foster healthy growth, and placing them too close might put your plants at risk of burning due to the heat emitted by the light. 

Sometimes, staying too close to the light source can heat the water in the plant cells, causing your succulents to be dehydrated. Of course, you don't want this to happen, so set the lights at a safe distance. When setting up, ensure that a balance is maintained between the intensity of light and heat that the plant gets.

For tube lights and CFL bulbs, we recommend placing them almost 6-12 inches away from your succulents. However, for LED lights, the distance varies depending on the type and intensity of light being used. Generally, the distance should be 18-24 inches from your succulents.

### 2. Hours

Your succulents do not need to be in light all the time. Give them some time in the dark for around 10-12 hours a day to maintain a healthy growth cycle. You don't want the grow lights to harm your succulents, so keep monitoring them closely for a few days to make sure they are invigorated.
