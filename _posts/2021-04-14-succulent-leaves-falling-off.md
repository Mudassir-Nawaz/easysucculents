  answer: Succulents are xerophytes meaning they store water. Therefore, you have to water your succulents more but less often. If you overwater them, you may risk them losing their leaves.
- question: Do succulents require fertilizers?
  answer: Like other plants, succulents need fertlizers. But excessive use of chemicals can actually harm the plants as they drop leaves in reaction. Ideally, you would want organic feed for your succulents.

## Introduction

It isn't very pleasant when plants shed their leaves. Not only is this messy, but it is also disheartening. Especially with houseplants, like succulents, you don't want any falling leaves.

If you have never wondered what causes falling leaves, you probably wish to be aware of how you can prevent this from happening. In this post, I will tell you about some reasons that are causing the loss of leaves and what you can do to stop it.  

**Several factors are responsible for falling leaves of succulents. These factors include improper watering, imbalanced exposure to light, unsuitable temperature, excessive use of fertilizers, and the use of inhospitable soil.**

## Reason 1: Improper Watering 

Improper watering of succulents is one of the most common reasons for falling leaves. Since succulents store water, they do not require frequent watering like many other houseplants. People often confuse succulents with ordinary houseplants and overwater them. One of the consequences of overwatering is the falling of leaves.

A great tip for watering your succulent is by first viewing its leaves. If they are big and fluffy, it means they already have ample water. At this point, if you will water the plant further, it will shed leaves.

Moreover, another helpful tip is to water your plant less frequently. This means you have to water the succulent sufficiently and wait long enough to get its topmost soil dry. Once this happens, water it again. If you are interested in knowing more details about the watering regime, you would love this post:

Additionally, you have to make sure that your pot has holes in it. This will help in draining extra water and will keep your plant dry. A dry plant will shed leaves less often.

## Reason 2: Imbalanced Exposure to Light

Exposure to more or less sunlight is another reason for falling leaves. Plants need light to complete the process of photosynthesis. This process helps plants in getting the energy that they need. 

However, for many succulents, exposure to direct and heavy sunlight is not appreciated. In reaction, they shed their leaves. So, if your plant is placed in a spot with ample direct sunlight, you might want to bring it under partial shade.

On the flip side, in the absence of ample sunlight, succulents also shed their leaves. This case is particularly relevant in the case of indoor succulents. You don't want to light-starve your plant either. To avoid this, make sure your room has exposure to direct sunlight or otherwise, keep wiping fallen leaves off your floor.   

## Reason 3: Unsuitable Temperature

Often, unsuitable temperatures are also the reason for falling leaves. If your plant is exposed to extremely cold conditions, don't expect its leaves to be healthy. Frosty conditions hinder water storage in leaves. As a result, they fall off.

Similarly, the hot and humid conditions of your room can also be the reason for falling leaves. Hot temperature brings the plant under stress. Resultantly, the plant starts to consume the stored water at a higher rate. The absence of requisite stored water causes the leaves to fall off. If your plant is in the room, air conditioning will help your cause!


## Reason 4: Excessive Use of Fertilizers

Succulents do not always love fertilizers. Too much exposure to foreign elements is another cause of falling leaves. While succulents love nitrogen, phosphorous, and magnesium, excess fertilizers containing these elements can harm their health.

In an ideal case, you would want to fertilize your plant organically. Coffee ground and manure teabags are some of the organic ways in which you can fertilize your plants. Here is where you can get 100% natural manure teabags {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Sustane-CTB-Compost-Tea-Bags/dp/B00QYIWYFQ" text="100% natural manure teabags"%}.

## Reason 5: Use of Inhospitable Soil

Another contributing factor for falling leaves of succulents is the use of inhospitable soil. Succulents do not love ordinary garden soil. Since they hate too much moisture, a combination of common garden soil and coarse sand is what they love. Ideally, you would want your soil mix to contain a fifth of either coconut coir, or perlite. This soil mix will also make succulent leaves strong.
