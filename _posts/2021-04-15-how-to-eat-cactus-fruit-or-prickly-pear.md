## How to eat the Prickly Pear Fruit?

If you eat the Prickly Pear Fruit without taking precautions, you may end up hurting yourself.

The safest way to eat a prickly pear fruit involves 

### Step 1: Get the Right Equipment

To eat cactus fruit, you need the right equipment. How else will you safely be able to extract the fruit's flesh and feast on it? Here are a few things that you need to gather:

- A sharp metallic knife to cut open the fruit
- Thick gloves to cover your hands which you can {% include link-amazon.html link="B07T7Z1RB8" text="buy from here"%} or {% include link-amazon.html link="B003DZ03KQ" text="here"%}
- A cutting board 
- A pair of tongs if you're harvesting the fruit directly

{% include pro-tip.html title="pro tip" subtitle="" content="If you don't have tongs, you can wrap 5 to 6 towels to make a thick base to pick your prickly pear from the plant." %}

### Step 2: Identify the Digestible Cactus Fruit

Prickly pear fruit comes displays variation in color. It is interesting to note that the flavor also fluctuates with the color. Darker fruits like the ones that are purple tend to be sweeter. The most common prickly pear fruit color available in the market is dark green and dark purple. 

{% include image.html image="image2.jpg" alt="3 different coloured prickly pears" %}

If you're harvesting prickly pear yourself, use a pair of tongs to separate it from the plant. Protect your hands by wearing thick gloves. **Whatever you do, do not touch the fruit barehandedly!**

{% include warning.html title="Important note" subtitle="Choosing the right prickly pear is crucial" content="You might find many prickly pears in the market, but not all of them will taste good. Choose wisely!" %}

### Step 3: Remove all the spines and glochids

The entire surface of cactus fruit is embellished with sharp needle-like thorns. **The spots on the skin of prickly pear are called glochids.** These hair-like spines can be your worst nightmare. If you consume glochids, they can trigger you and can irritate your skin. So it is important to get remove glochids from the fruit.

{% include image.html image="image4.jpg" alt="ripe prickly pears in the field" %}

Usually, store-bought prickly pears are free from spines and glochids, but it is better to wear gloves while dealing with them just in case.

To remove the glochids yourself, take a blow torch and burn away all the spines. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="pro tip" subtitle="Get rid of glochids" content="Never eat a fruit with glochids. Instead attempt to remove it by using either a pair of tweezers, glue or duct tape." %}

If you happen to see glochids on your store-brought fruit, no need to panic. Just remove the glochids with a pair of tweezers. If that doesn't seem like an appealing idea, there are a few other things you can do too. Another easy way to do this task is to cover the glochids with Elmer's Glue-All or white glue and cover it with a gauze. Leave it to dry for 30 minutes and then peel it off. Otherwise use duct tape, as it will also do the same job of extracting glochids

### Step 4: Cut the Fruit And Feast On the Pulp

Here comes the final step. Now its time to reap the fruit of your efforts!

- Place your prickly pear on the cutting board
- Grab your knife and cut both ends of the fruit.
- Now, make a slight cut within the skin at the center of the fruit.
- With the help of your hands, peel off the skin.
- Go ahead and eat the beautiful and incredibly delicious pulp.
