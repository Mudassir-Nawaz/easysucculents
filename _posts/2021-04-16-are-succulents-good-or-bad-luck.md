## Introduction

In many cultures, it is widely believed that owning certain plants can improve luck. Apart from their beauty, this perception of luckiness is a major reason behind the popularity of succulents. But do succulents really do anything for the luck of their owners?

Well, this claim has no scientific backing. It is just a cultural belief. And while many think succulents bode well for their future, there are still many cultures in which these plants are considered bad luck. So, there is no definitive way to ascertain whether succulents are good or bad luck.

**Different cultures link having succulents with good or bad luck. But there is nothing with succulents, per se, to that end. However, you can always associate your plant with your good moments to make them a lucky charm for you**

## Succulents As Good Luck

In ancient Chinese mythology, individuals can harmonize their energy with their surroundings to get happiness and good vibes. The idea of using plants for good luck is also a product of this mythology. The technique of harmonizing energies is also called Feng shui.

One of the teachings of Feng Shui is to plant succulents for good charm. According to this tradition, wealth, prosperity, and well-being are often associated with planting succulents. The fact that this idea took birth in China is also the reason behind the widespread association of succulents and good luck in the Indo-China region.

Before succulents became worldwide, they were particularly common in the Indo-China region. These plants are still hot sellers around the Chinese New Year time in much of China. Today, succulents are ubiquitous. But not everyone views them as luck boosters. The association of luck and succulents is not very popular in Western and North American cultures. But this belief is still potent in China and the Sub-continent.

While there is little scientific backing of this association, one thing is for sure: {% include link-authority.html link="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/indoor-plants-can-instantly-boost-your-health-happiness-ncna781806" text="succulents do give you good vibes and planting them can make you happy." %}

What is for sure is that succulents are beautiful. You can plant one on your happy day to associate the memory of that event with the plant. This way, your plant will make you smile every time you will have a look at it!

## Succulents As Bad Luck

According to the same Feng Shui tradition, some succulents can bring bad luck. Planting succulents with thorns in your room can bring misfortune, according to this centuries-old Chinese belief.

There are several ways in which thorny succulents can bring you misfortune. The Chinese tradition holds that placing your succulent at the entrance of your house can cut short the number of guests. 

Similarly, the Feng Shui tradition maintains that planting spiky succulents in your kitchen will cause your food to taste bad. This will eventually kill your appetite and make you unhealthy.

Moreover, planting a succulent by the side of your bed can bring intimacy problems with your partner. This can cause trust issues among partners and can even spoil happy marriages.

Thorny succulents and bad luck are still linked very strongly according to the cultural belief in the Indo-Chinese region. However, this idea has little traction in the Western world and the Americas. 


## Plant a Succulent on a Memorable Day to Always Feel Lucky!

Since there is no definitive way to say whether succulents bring good or bad luck, you can plant them on your happy days to always feel good about them. For example, if you plant one in your room the day you have a kid, you will always see the plant in a good mood.

Similarly, if you plant a succulent on a day you get a promotion, you will smile whenever you look at it. This is regardless of what the unproven Chinese mythology holds.


## Conclusion 

The idea of associating luck with succulents is a cultural construct. It has little to do with evidence-based scientific knowledge. In many cultures, planting succulents can bring good or bad luck, depending on the type of plant. There are still many cultures that discard this idea altogether.

What is common is that succulents are beautiful. And that they can lift your mood with their unique colors and graceful presence. A nice workaround is to make your own associations: by planting them on your good days to feel blessed and lucky every time you give them a look!
