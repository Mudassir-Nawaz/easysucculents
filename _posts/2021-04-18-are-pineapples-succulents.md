## What's This Post About?

It is often contemplated if pineapples can be classified under the umbrella of succulents. Well, for many reasons, the answer is a clear yes! 

What makes us say that Pineapples are succulents? The characteristics of the tropical fruit make it evident that it roots from the family of succulents. 

If you pay close attention, you'll note that the traits of pineapples are quite similar to succulents.

**Pineapples are succulents because they can survive in similar atmospheres as other succulents. They are adapted to thrive in conditions with low water, and just like other succulents, their stems and leaves can store water. This gives the pineapple leaves and stems a thick and rubbery texture.**

## What Are Succulents?

Before we move any further to understand how pineapples are succulents, it is vital to know what succulents are.

Succulents are plants with thick, swollen, fleshy leaves and stems. These tissues are adapted to store and retain water in the plant. Grouping the family of drought-resistant plants, we call them succulents. These plants are well adapted to growing in arid and semi-arid regions.

Generally, succulents grow in areas with low water availability, such as deserts and arid regions. A quite common example is cactus, so you might have guessed that succulents can grow well in intense sun, with little to no water. 

It's not just about the topography of the area where they grow. Succulents have distinct physical traits that set them apart from other plants.

You might note that succulent plants have quite engorged, thick, and fleshy leaves. That's not the case with all the plants? Unlike the thin and slender leaves of most plants, succulents vary in appearance.

Another characteristic peculiar to succulents is that they produce edible fruits. Most succulents produce edible fruit; even many varieties of cacti product fruits are edible. The fruits produced by succulents are generally quite pulpy with higher water content.

Now that we know the specific characteristics of succulents let's read further to discover how pineapples are succulents.

## Are Pineapples Succulents? How?

Originating from the family of Bromeliads, pineapples are tropical, perennial plants. Almost all of us know of the exotically sweet and juicy fruit the plant produces. 

Let's explore the characteristics of pineapples closely - and why they fit the definition of succulents.

{% include image.html image="blooming-pineapple.jpg" alt="a growning pineapple" %} 

### Rough Physical Appearance

Pineapple plants are designed to be adaptable to dry climates. Just like cacti, you may notice that pineapple plants are spiky and thick on the outside. This fleshy outer layer of the pineapple plant plays a vital role in water retention.

If you look carefully, you'll note that the plant is arranged in a spiral, forming a rosette extending to more than a meter in height.

Assessing the plant closely, you'll note that pineapples resemble in appearance to succulents.

### Thick and Sturdy Leaves

Pineapple plants have long, thick and spiky leaves, just like other succulents. The tough and rubbery leaves help it to store water. The plant uses this stored water when it's not readily available.

### Intensity of Light

These drought-resistant species are accustomed to an abundant amount of sunlight. Keep them in direct sunlight or a slightly shaded area, and they will grow quite well.

Pineapples are among those sun-loving plants that cannot thrive well in low intensities of light. Growing in tropical regions, they have adapted to warmer climates.

### Pineapple Flowers

Among the few succulents that produce flowers, pineapple is one. As the pineapple plant matures, it begins to bloom flowers. 

Initially, a flower spike will emerge, but instead of a flowering bract, the pineapple flower grows on top of this spike. 

This rigid flower spine helps to hold up the bulky pineapple fruit.

### Edible Pineapple Fruit

The major characteristic of all succulents is their production of edible fruits. Pineapples also follow the same trait.

The aromatic, juicy pineapple fruit that we consume is a product of almost 100-200 flowers and berries of the plant. These berries and flowers merge to form a single, weighty fruit.

The pineapple fruit is an amalgamation of innumerable berries fused together. Botanically, due to their composition, pineapples can be considered berries.

Pineapples are inevitably succulents. They are quite rich in juice and fluids, which is a compelling characteristic of succulent fruits.

### Environmental Requisites

Pineapples are native to tropical regions, so they grow in similar habitats. Drought-resistant in nature, pineapples best grow in well-drained soil. The soil should not be wet; otherwise, the roots might get clogged.

A slightly acidic pH of the soil is ideal, but even a neutral pH level promotes the healthy growth of the plant. 

Even though pineapples can withstand scarcity of water, they are also able to thrive well in areas with abundant rainfall. As long as the water is draining out of the soil and the pineapple plant is not sitting in water, there won't be a problem.

### Propagating Pineapple Plants

{% include image.html image="pineapple-succulent.jpg" alt="An image of pineapple plants." %}

Just like other members of the succulent family, pineapples are fairly easy to propagate and grow around. 

The new pineapple plant emerges from the mother plant or the fruit itself. To propagate, simply cut a few leaves from the top of the plant, and a slice of pineapple fruit is needed. 

The soil needs to meet the requisites of the pineapple plant. It should be well-drained but moist. The roots will eventually grow, and the new plant would begin to grow.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="Do you know that just like most succulents, the rough and thick leaves of pineapples protect the plant from pests and insects? Even if the pests land on the plant leaves, the thick texture of the leaves makes it difficult for the pests to penetrate in and feed on the plant sap.This way, the Pineapple plant stays protected from possible infestations." %}

## Can You Grow A Pineapple Plant at Home Like Other Succulents? 

**Growing pineapples at home is quite a simple and fun task. Whether you want to plant them indoors or outdoors, just make sure you meet the necessary needs of the plants.**

As long as the plant is planted in well-drained soil and is getting plenty of moisture and its fair share of warmth with 8-10 hours of direct sunlight, your home-grown pineapples will thrive.

Your pineapple plant will ripe in almost two years. This time varies according to the conditions the plant grows in.
