- question: How to propagate succulents?
  answer: You can propagate succulents via stem cuttings, leaf cuttings and even beheading. The baby plants are sensitive and need extra attention and care at the start of their new life.
- question: Is leaf propagation hard?
  answer: Propagating a plant through leaf cuttings will not be too difficult. However, you need to start with taking more leaves to improve the odds of propagation as each leaf doesn't grow as it should.
- question: What is the right way to treat a propagated plant?

## Introduction

Succulents are one of the only trends that deserve all of the hype, and once you get started, it's near impossible to be content with owning only one succulent.

In addition to being great for your bedroom, kitchen, study - the list goes on, and on - succulents also make great gifts and party favors. They are extremely easy to propagate, making them a delightful to own.

**Propagating succulents is not challenging. It can be done through cuttings from the leaves, the stems, and even the bulbs. Once you propagate them, it is vital to give them a safe environment to heal and revive themselves. Take extra care of your plant after starting the propagation process.**

## What is Propagation?

If you are new to the world of succulents and your thumb isn't green just yet, chances are the concept of propagating succulents is new to you.

**Put simply, and adorably, propagating succulents is the process by which you use your adult succulents to create little baby succulents.**

## Leaf Cutting.

This is the first and most common method of propagation.

The first step in leaf-cutting propagation is gently removing a few leaves from the succulent you wish to replicate.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip!" subtitle="" content="Leaves do not always propagate successfully, so take a few more than you think you will need." %}

Once you have removed the leaves, please place them in indirect sunlight to dry.

Within a few days, the leaves should heal by forming calluses where they were removed from the stem.

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="" content="Do not water the leaves or place them in the soil before they have healed completely or they will rot." %}

Once the leaves have healed, please place them in a shallow container filled with cactus mix and gently push the bottom of the leaf into the soil.

This container should then be placed in indirect sunlight and the soil watered frequently to encourage the growth of new succulents.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip!" subtitle="" content="To avoid overwatering, we recommend using a spray bottle to mist the soil." %}

After a few weeks, your new succulents should be ready to be transplanted into their own individual pots to continue growing.

## Beheading.

Don't worry; the second method of propagation is much more pleasant than it sounds.

If you have a succulent that has become elongated, the process of beheading can be used to produce new succulents.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip!" subtitle="" content="To prevent the elongation of succulents in the future, ensure that they have sufficient light." %}

Firstly, gently remove the leaves from the stem of the succulent being beheaded.

Once the leaves have been removed, cut and remove the head of the succulent.

You should now be left with a potted stem.

Once the beheaded stem has sufficient light and water, it will replace its old leaves and head with new succulents.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="The removed head can also be repotted as a new plant, so make sure to keep it intact when removing it from the stem." %}

## Stem Cutting.

This is the third and arguably the easiest method of propagation.

Firstly, take a pair of shears and remove part of the stem.

Once the stem has healed by forming a callus, place it into cactus mix, and water as usual.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="Some succulents, for example the Aeonium, can only be propagated through stem cutting." %}

## Additional Resources.

In addition to the methods listed above, here are some things to keep in mind when propagating succulents.

### Tip 1: Use well-draining soil.

We recommend using cactus mix to plant your succulents rather than regular soil, which holds moisture, resulting in death.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="You can make your own cactus mix using soil, sand and pebbles." %}

### Tip 2: Do not overwater your succulent.

The new succulents will need to be watered a lot less frequently after propagation.

###: Tip 3: Use a Planter with Drainage Holes.

Like the previous tips, buying a planter that allows for drainage will help ensure that your succulents are not overwatered.
