- question: Why do I have to water the plant more often in the growing season?
  answer: Succulents grow faster in the growing season and hence require more energy. Water is a necessary component in photosynthesis that the plant needs to have to survive!
- question: Is it better to water my plant with tap water or rain water?
  answer: The best thing you can do for your plant is water it with natural water. Rain water is free from artificially added minerals and works the best for your green succulents.

## Introduction

Due to their ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions, succulents have a reputation of being indestructible and therefore perfect for those of us who do not have the greenest of thumbs.

And while it is true that succulents are much more resilient than other houseplants - looking at you gardenia - they still need to be watered to survive.

**Generally, you should water your succulent only once the topmost soil in the pot has dried. This can take 2 weeks. Daily watering is not advised and could cause your succulent to get sick. Reduce the frequency during the dormant period and only add a feeding solution if you must in the growing season.**

## Tip 1: Only Water Dry Soil.

I'm sure that when you decided to research how to water your succulents, your main concern was whether or not they were getting enough water, but did you know that succulents can be overwatered?

When caring for your succulents, it is important to remember that, being desert natives, they are built to withstand long periods of time without water.

So please, resist the urge to water your succulents every few days and wait until the soil they have been planted in is dry and crumbly, otherwise the prolonged exposure to moisture will cause the roots of the succulents to rot.

## Tip 2: Pay Attention to the Seasons.

Like other plants, succulents have periods of growth and dormancy.

During periods of growth, succulents must be watered more frequently as they use the water to create new roots, stems, leaves and blooms.

However, when succulents are dormant, they require less water.

As such, knowing when your succulent is dormant versus when it is active is necessary to provide proper care.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="While you may be tempted to assume that all succulents grow in the summer, some species are actually summer dormant." %}

Examples of Summer and Winter Dormant Succulents:

| Summer Dormant | Winter Dormant |
|----------------|----------------|
| Aeonium        | Adenium        |
| Aloe           | Agave          |
| Dudleya        | Ceropegia      |
| Kalanchoe      | Euphorbia      |
| Senecio        | Lithops        |


## Tip 3: Soil to Succulent Ratio.

Plant pot size is a factor that is often overlooked when caring for succulents.

Soil holds moisture, the bigger your pot is, the more soil required to fill it and vice versa.

Therefore, if the container your succulent has been planted in is on the larger side, it will not have to be watered as often as one in a smaller container.

{% include warning.html title="Warning." subtitle="" content="If your container is far too big, your succulents will die as the soil will not dry." %}

## Tip 4: Exposure to Sunlight.

Sunlight is great for succulents, however, the more heat succulents are exposed to, the more frequently they need to be watered.

To avoid scorching your succulents in direct sunlight, we suggest using a sheer curtain as a shield between your succulents and the sun, especially when propagating.

## Tip 5: Adjust for Your Climate.

When deciding how often you should water your succulents, consider your climate.

Do you live in an area that experiences cool temperatures and high humidity for the majority of the year?

If you answered yes, you will need to water your succulents a lot less often than someone who lives in a hot, dry climate.

## Tip 6: Create a Schedule.

A quick Google search will tell you that on average, succulents should be watered every two to three weeks.

And while this is a good place to start, it does not take into consideration many of the factors mentioned above.

This and the fact that every succulent is unique, means that the best way to determine when to water your succulents is by creating a watering schedule.

{% include image.html image="types-of-succulents.jpg" alt="Picture of a Variety of Succulents" %}

### How to Create a Watering Schedule.

Whether you use an app, calendar or bullet journal, the steps to creating a watering schedule are the same.

The schedule should start on the first day you water your succulent.

Then, for the next few weeks, keep track of every time the soil becomes dry and needs to be watered.

Eventually, once all other conditions remain relatively constant, the schedule will give you an idea of your succulent's water needs.

## Tip 7: Pay Attention to Your Succulents.

Succulents store waters in their leaves, as such, the leaves are great indicators of a succulent's health.

If the leaves are soft, detach easily and appear transluscent, your succulent is being overwatered.

In less severe cases, the succulent may be saved by removing it from the wet soil and allowing it to dry out before replanting.

{% include warning.html title="Warning." subtitle="" content="If the leaves and stem appear black, your succulent has begun to rot." %}

If the entire succulent cannot be saved, remove some of the healthy leaves to propagate.

On the other hand, rubbery, wrinkled leaves are tell-tale signs of an under-watered succulent.

To fix this issue, drench the dry soil and adjust your watering schedule.

## Tip 8: Succulent Specific Soil.

As mentioned multiple times in this post, proper drainage is imperative to the survival of your succulents.

Instead of using regular soil which holds moisture, we recommend using cactus mix.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact!" subtitle="" content="You can make your own cactus mix using soil, sand and pebbles." %}

{% include image.html image="cactus-mix.jpg" alt="Picture of Succulents Potted in Cactus Mix" %}


## Tip 9: Use Planters with Built-in Drainage.

Yes... another drainage tip.

Don't worry, this one is very straight forward.

Planters with holes prevent excess water from settling and protect your succulents from prolonged exposure to moisture.

## Tip 10: Use Rain Water.

It is unlikely that tap water will kill your succulents.

However, many succulent growers have reported excellent results when they switched to rain water.

## Conclusion.

You must generally water your succulent once every two weeks. However, only do if you have ensured the topmost soil is dry. A plant exposed to too much sunlight may have to be watered more often. Research more about the specific plant to find better watering guidelines for your beloved succulent.
