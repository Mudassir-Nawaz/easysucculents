## Introduction

Succulents are known to be hardy and easy to care for and, that's what makes them so lovable. But this doesn't mean that you can leave it to the mercy of the environment once you plant it. Succulents need to be catered from time to time to ensure they are getting enough light, water, and nutrition. 

If you haven't checked on your succulent for a while and now see uprooted roots, then this might be the right time to start worrying about your succulent. Do worry, but don't panic. We can fix this together.  

**Why is my succulent uprooting: if it's indoor, this is most likely happening due to lack of sunlight, and if it's outdoors, heavy winds and other environmental factors could be the cause. The best long-term solution would be to repot the succulent in a sunny and safe place.**

### Sunlight

On average, a succulent requires about **3 to 4 hours** of direct sunlight every day. Most of the succulents prefer the early morning sun, not the harsh afternoon sun that causes sunburns. So if your succulent is uprooted, it's most likely due to the lack of light.

In the case of rosette-shaped succulents, they tend to flatten out or curl their leaves when they are not getting enough light. You will also see a bit of stretching at the center of rosettes that clearly demonstrates the plant's efforts to get some light. All these symptoms symbolize the lack of proper light.

If you see such symptoms or see the leaves falling apart, then the best long-term remedy would be to move the plant to a sunny location. If that's not possible, you can try using a bright LED or CFL light, like this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/AeroGarden-45w-Grow-Light-Panel/dp/B0725QBG1G" text="45 w LED grow light"%} available at Amazon.

After changing the environment of your succulents, you need to keep a close eye on the daily growth of your plant. If the succulent's health isn't improving even after this, then there might be some other cause for your succulent's uprooting.

### Soil problems

In the ideal scenario, a succulent grows in bright light and well-drained soil. So, if you checked the light and that wasn't the reason for uprooting, you need to check your succulent's soil. In the case of soil conditions, it can be that your plant doesn't like the current soil conditions, and therefore, it has started uprooting.

You need to have well-drained soil for your succulent.

### Root Depth

The third reason that may behind the uprooted succulent is root depth. In this case, you need to check if your succulent's roots is deep in the soil or not. If not, then carefully dig the sides of your plant and try to get the soil directly under the succulent's roots. Now put the removed soil back into the pot to rebury it.

### Outdoor Environment

If your succulent is placed outdoors, then it can also get uprooted by several weather factors. For many garden succulents, the major cause of uprooting is harsh winds and bad weather.

So, whenever you want to repot your succulent, firstly, you need to remove it from its current pot gently. Then place the roots in a safe place away from direct sunlight or rain and let it dry out for almost **3 to 5 days**. Next, remove the soil from the roots and gently rinse them. For extra protection, wrap the roots in a plastic bag and let them dry out for the required time.

Most of the succulents out there can be propagated using cuttings too. So, for this method, you need to take a broken leaf or a stem of your succulent and let it dry out for about **5 to 7 days**. Then place the end part of that stem inside the soil and keep watering it once every week. You will start seeing new leaves after a week.
