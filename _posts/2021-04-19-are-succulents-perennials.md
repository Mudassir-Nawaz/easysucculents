## Introduction

Succulents have adapted themselves to store water in their stems, root, and leaves, making them incredibly resilient. If you’re planning on getting one for your home, you may wonder whether they are evergreen perennials or annuals. You might also be confused about these classifications!

**Succulents are mostly evergreen perennials. However, there are some annual ones too. Apart from that, some perennial succulents may behave like an annual plant when growing in unsuitable climates. These succulents are known as tender perennials.**

## Are Succulents Perennials?

**Succulents are overwhelmingly perennials. They are evergreen and tend to stay alive for more than two years. However, some perennials behave like annuals in areas where the winter is harsher than the summers. There are also a few annual succulents, but they are rare.**

The forgiving nature of succulents makes them appealing to others. After all, they are spectacular specimens of nature that do not punish you even if you neglect them. They have evolved in a way that makes them undemanding and uncomplicated to raise.

Hardiness is the ability of a plant to survive in outdoor settings during the winter. However, evergreen perennials are plants that live more than two years at a time!" %}

Have you ever wondered why succulents are so popular? The truth is that these plants are easy to handle and reward the grower abundantly! Some of the most popular types of evergreen succulents are actually cacti, which can thrive without water.

I love perennial succulents, and if you’re a beginner, I know which one you should get.

The low-maintenance needs of succulents coupled with the status of being a perennial is a dream come true! You don’t have to put in a lot of hard work to see the plant prosper, bloom and flourish. What could be better than that?

## What Are the Types of Succulent?

Most succulents are known to be perennials. However, a small quantity also qualifies as annuals. 

### 1. What is a Perennial Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="Technically, a perennial succulent is an evergreen plant that lives more than two years!" %}

**Perennial succulents are plants that store water within their stem, roots or leaves and can live for more than two years. Most succulents are both evergreen perennials like cacti, ghost plants and salvias.**

Evergreen perennial succulents are generally hardy and do not throw a fuss. If you fulfil their essential requirement and feed them, and water them appropriately, you will see them in your possession for a long time.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Don’t worry if your perennial succulent doesn’t bloom in the first two years of growing!" content="Perennial succulents take time to produce flowers consistently. Many breeds do not bloom until two growing seasons have passed. Therefore, relax if your succulent is in infancy and hasn’t flowered yet. Treat it right, and you’ll be on your way to beautiful blooms in the future." %}

### 2. What is a Tender Perennial Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="Tender perennials are perennials in their original climates but can’t behave the same in chillier regions!" %}

**Tender perennials or soft succulents are plants that originate from areas with warm climates. When planted in cooler regions, these plants require special care to stay alive through the winters. At times these tender perennials are treated as annuals by gardeners since they can’t withstand chilly winters.**

Examples of tender perennial succulents include:

- Echeveria
- Kalanchoe
- Aloe
- Tender Sedums
- Aeonium tabuliforme
- Manfreda
- Senecio

Tender perennials need extra attention to survive the winters. While some gardeners opt to treat them as annuals, sometimes this is not feasible. The solution is to bring the tender perennials indoors and help them go through the period of dormancy without dying.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle= "Consider cutting back the tender perennial succulent before you bring it indoors!" content="When you bring in the tender perennial indoors, try to cut it back by about half beforehand. Since succulent cuttings perform better when brought back outdoors, it is best to do this. After all, it will give the plant the most chance to revive itself and grow properly when transplanted outside!" %}

When you have a tender perennial, you might be sentimentally attached to it. Therefore, please do your best and give it a fair chance to thrive!

### 3. What is an Annual Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="Annual succulents are a rarity in the plant world, but they do exist!" %}

**Annual succulents are those succulents that go through the process of germination to dying in one season. These succulents usually abundantly flower so that they can reproduce themselves without much ado. Examples include Amaranthus caudatus and Portulaca Oleracea.**

{% include pro-tip.html title="Did you Know?" subtitle="" content="Love-Lies-Bleeding or the Amaranthus caudatus is a gorgeous annual succulent that has traditionally been associated with hopeless love! The flower has a special meaning in the Victorian language of flowers." %}

If you’re interested in raising an annual succulent, why don’t you try out the love lies bleeding? I enjoyed raising this exquisite flowering annual last year. It was a wonderful experience, and I couldn’t have asked for more.

Do consider getting these seeds which made things a whole lot easier for me:

## Conclusion

Succulents are usually evergreen perennials. It is rare but possible for there to be annual succulents too. At times perennials are treated as annuals because of the plant’s inability to withstand cooler environments.
