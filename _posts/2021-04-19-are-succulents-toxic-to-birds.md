## Introduction

Ensuring your pet bird’s safety and well-being is a significant responsibility. When you have plants in your home, you need to make sure that they are not toxic. In other words, you must only store safe succulents and avoid poisonous ones.

**All succulents are not toxic to birds. Toxic ones include Mother of Thousands, String of Pearls, Yucca, Amaryllis, Mother in Law’s Tongue and Jade Plant. Non-toxic succulents include Hens and Chicks, Christmas Cactus, Aloe Vera, Spider Plant and Burro’s Tail.**

## Are Succulents Toxic to Birds?

**All succulents are not a threat to the well-being of birds. Some of them have poisonous sap, which can irritate them if ingested. Generally, avoid Mother of Thousands, String of Pearls, Yucca, Amaryllis, Mother in Law’s Tongue and Jade Plant. Instead, choose safer options like the Christmas Cactus.**

Symptoms of bird poisoning can range from mild to extreme. However, in general, you can expect the bird to vomit, experience diarrhoea, lethargy, urinate more often or face tremors. If things are too severe, you can see them falling from their perching place, have convulsions and even go into a coma!

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="If you suspect your bird is poisoned rush to the veteranarian" content="Birds have small organs that react very seriously to exposure to poison. Don't take a risk and rush to the vet if your pet is showing symptoms like vomiting and dizziness" %}

Don’t let your birds suffer, and ensure you give them a safe environment free from toxic plants.

## What Succulents are Toxic to Birds?
Here are a few succulents that you need to avoid so that you can protect your beloved birds:

|     **Name of Toxic   Succulents**    |     **Scientific   Name**         |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|     Mother of   Thousands             |     Kalanchoe   Daigremontiana    |
|     String of   Pearls                |     Senecio   rowleyanus          |
|     Yucca                             |     Yucca                         |
|     Amaryllis                         |     Amaryllis                     |
|     Mother in   Law’s Tongue          |     Dracaena   trifasciata        |
|     Jade Plant                        |     Crassula   ovata              |


### 1. Mother of Thousands Plant

{% include quote.html quote="When considering the mother of thousands plant, you need to know that every single part of it is toxic!" %}

The Mother of Thousands is an attractive houseplant that rarely blooms. While it has stunning foliage and may have beautiful lavender flowers, it is not safe for pets. Every part of this breathtaking succulent is poisonous and can even be fatal if ingested by your feathery friends. Don’t think about keeping this plant anywhere near a bird! 

### 2. String of Pearls Plant

The String of Pearls is a trailing succulent that has small spherical leaves that resemble precious tiny pearls. However, don’t let the cuteness fool you. The plant is clearly poisonous. If your birds ingest any part of this, expect drooling, diarrhoea, vomiting, lethargy or even death! Contact the vet if you suspect your bird has consumed a part of this succulent!

### 3. Yucca Plant

Plants from the Yucca species tend to be stemless and feature rosette formations with small leaves at the base. The flowers are usually white but can have a tint of pink or green as well. Yucca plants contain a chemical component called saponins which are to blame for the toxicity. Don’t waste any time calling the vet if the bird has ingested it!

Therefore, keep it as far away as you can from them.

Your best bet is to keep this plant as far away as you can!
