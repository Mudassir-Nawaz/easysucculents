## Introduction

In my opinion, Snake plants are one of the prettiest succulents. They have won my heart because they are easy to take care of and propagate. What could be better than that? A little something I like to do is to propagate the succulent and give the baby plant to my friends as a gift!

**Propagating snake plants is easy, and it can be done using four different techniques. The first one is propagating them in the water, the second one is done on the soil, the third one happens by dividing it, and the fourth one happens through the rhizome.**

## Propagating in the water

**Propagating Snake Plants in water is an easy process that will take patience more than anything else. Once the roots are out, it will take only about 3 to 5 weeks to get a new Snake Plant.**

To propagate the plant in the water, you'll have to choose a healthy leaf that's not too old. Once you choose it, cut it from the mother plant and make a v-shaped cut on the bottom end. Divide the leaf into sections of 2 to 3 inches, always marking the bottom with v-shaped cuts.

After cutting the leaves, please place them in the shadow and let them dry out to callus. This is important because if the cut doesn't callus, the leaf won't be able to regenerate and create a new plant. 

Once this happens, you'll take all the cuttings and place them in a glass container with water slightly above the v-shaped cut and keeping your leaf section above the bottom of the container. You can use any clip to do this.

It's really important to place the cutting in the same position as it was in the leaf. If you don't, your snake plant won't grow. 

Snake plants grow slowly, so it may take a while for you to see the first roots coming out of the cutting, but when you see them appear, you can rejoice. It is time for you to choose to grow the snake plant in the water or in the soil.  Read ahead to learn how to grow it in the soil.

Once the roots are at least one inch long, you should plant the leaf as deep as the water was on the leaf. After this, you need to wait a little more until a brand new Snake Plant starts blooming. The old one won't bloom anymore, and you can even remove it from the soil when the new one looks strong.

## Propagating in the soil

**Propagating Snake Plant in the soil is a one-step process. This is its biggest advantage compared to the propagation in water since propagating in water ends up planting the new plant on the soil later.**

Cut the leaf close to the soil and make sections that are 2 to 3 inches long. Make the v-shaped on the bottom of all of them and let them callus, just like you would do when propagating in water.

When the cuttings appear to have callused, pot them directly in the soil covering the v-shaped cutting. For this kind of propagation, keeping the soil mildy moist is critical. 

## Propagating by division

**Dividing a Snake Plant is the fastest way to have a new one. The method consists of unpotting the plant and dividing the roots, leaves, and rhizomes.**

The first thing to understand is that to do this, the plant should be mature. A baby plant won't be able to bear losing part of its roots and will probably die. However, if this requirement is fulfilled, we can keep going. 

To divide a Snake Plant, you'll un-pot it gently and look at the roots, use a sterile scissor to divide the root clump. Keep in mind that each of them should have roots and leaves. After this, re-pot them immediately.

## Propagating by Rhizome 

**Rhizomes are plant stems that stays underground, sending out roots. Snake Plants can easily grow from them.**

To divide by rhizome, you need to gently un-pot your Snake Plant; then you'll look at its rhizomes, looking for one that won't affect your plant so much when you take it from there. Once you find it, you'll cut it carefully. Please wait for it to callus and then plant. 

## Conclusion
Something worth mentioning is that if you intend to keep the pattern of the mother plant, the only method that guarantees that is the dividing one. The others can result in a variety of leaves that may not be the ones you're waiting for.

If your Snake Plant is overwatered, you can re-pot it in new soil, and it'll probably save your plant. If parts of the plant are dying, you can try to divide the good parts and start over with a brand new plant.

Snake Plants can be propagated in many ways, and all of them are somehow easy. Since they are popular plants, you can have a lot of fun propagating your Snake Plants and gifting them to your friends.
