### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Desert Rose Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Desert Rose Plant is not picky when it comes to soil conditions!" %}

**The ideal soil for the Desert Rose Plant will not be excessively moist. It may have materials like sand, perlite and potting substrate to ensure the succulent gets what it needs. If you want fat roots, involve sand and if you wish to slim roots use coco fibre.**

As the name suggests, the desert rose plant originates from a desert or an arid area. It is used to living in soil that barely holds moisture and refuses to be soggy. Root rot is a big no when it comes to this plant as it can’t stand waterlogging at all. Ensure that the pH requirements of being between 6.0 and 7.0 are also met, and you’re good to go.

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Desert Rose Plant?

The Desert Rose is a plant that blooms abundantly throughout the year, especially between Spring and Summer. Proper sunlight and a warm environment are crucial for keeping the succulent healthy. The plant can survive the winter; however, it may be semi-dormant until the growing season arrives again.

Repotting the Desert Rose Plant is not difficult! You must limit this task to the growing season between Spring and Summer as this will allow the succulent to adjust to the new pot.
