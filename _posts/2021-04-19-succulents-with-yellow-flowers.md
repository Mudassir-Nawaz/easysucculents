### Introduction

Yellow is one of the happiest colors on earth. If you love it as much as I do, why don’t you get more of it in your life? You can start by getting the stunning succulents on this list. They are really easy to take care of and will bloom the prettiest yellow flowers you’ll ever find!

**There are various yellow flower succulents in the market. The easiest ones to take care of include the Aloe Vera, Echeveria, Sedum, and Aeonium.**

## 1. Aloe Vera

**Aloe Vera will bloom when it’s mature. Don’t expect it to bloom before the plant turns four years old. It requires full sunlight, excellent soil with good drainage, proper watering, a pot that’s just the right size. Since it requires all these conditions, the plant is more likely to bloom when it’s outdoors.**

If you’re a proud parent of an indoor aloe, you can get it to bloom if you put in a little work on the position and watering. 

Aloe needs full sunlight exposure for 2 or 3 hours a day, which means a window facing either South or West is probably the best choice. To make sure the plant is getting even sun exposure, you can also rotate it every six months.

The ideal temperature to aloe is between 70° F to 80° F (or 21°C - 29° C) during the day and never below 60 F (15 C) during the night.

Another important factor to consider is the soil. The plant needs well-draining soil that will not allow the soil to get soggy. It doesn’t need to be fertilized, but if you are unhappy with the growth, you can add use a fertilizer with low amounts of phosphorus. 

Watering too much will also damage your aloe. As a rule of thumb, you can water it once a week in the summer and then once every other week in the winter. Always wait until the soil is completely drained before watering again.

The roots should be a little tight to let the plant grow healthy. The soil’s compactness is even more important if you’d like your aloe to bloom. Under normal conditions, you shouldn’t worry about repotting it before two years.

If you’ve done everything right, you’ll see your flower blooming in no time, probably between late winter to spring. If it’s an outdoor plant, you can expect many hummingbirds to roam your garden.

If you’re in love with Aloe Vera and can’t wait to get a plant at your home, here is a great {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Succulents-1-ALOE-4IN-Wedding-Events/dp/B0794G1L54" text="place"%} you can get one:

## 2. Echeveria

**Echeveria flower bloom if you treat them right. Please pay attention to the sunlight they get and the temperature they’re in, but other factors such as soil and watering are also not to be ignored. These succulents generally like dry and hot conditions.**

Sunlight is really important to have a great Echeveria. It’ll take from 4 to 5 hours of bright and direct sun to keep them happy. Even though they like sunlight, avoid placing them directly in the afternoon sun since it can be too aggressive and cause sunburns. 

The temperature they like the most is around 70° F. However, it is used to variations in the temperature as well. 

When choosing the soil, keep in mind that Echeveria likes to sit on dry soil. So a cactus mix will be able to keep at their healthiest. 

If you’re confused, I recommend you buy this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Hoffman-10410-Organic-Cactus-Succulent/dp/B0030UQLIM” " text="soil mix"%} for your Echeveria plant:

{% include image.html image="echeveria-yellow-flower.jpg" alt="echeveria with yellow flowers" %}

One of the biggest challenges with the echeveria plant is watering. To increase the chances of getting it right, give moderate levels of water to them in the hot, dry season. Before watering, make sure the topmost soil in the pot is completely dry.

You probably won’t need to repot it before two years.

When it comes to fertilizing the soil, it’s unnecessary, but if you’d like to make the plant grow a little faster when it is actively growing, use it. Make sure the fertilizer has no more than 5% nitrogen. The result will be pretty yellow flowers. 

The flower will bloom from a stalk and from bottom to top; as one dies, another will bloom. Echeveria flowers are known as one of the most beautiful flowers in the world of succulents.

## 3. Sedum

**Is a perennial flowering succulent that is easy to take care of and has the flowers distributed over a stem. To grow healthy sedum stems, you need to provide them with the right amount of water and nutrition.**

The best time to plant Sedum is in summer and spring because that is when they’re actively growing. 

Sedum likes direct sun. For it to bloom, it’ll need 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight every day. If you place them in the shade, they won’t die, but they won’t bloom as well. Since they need so much light, you should grow outdoor.

{% include image.html image="sedum-yellow-flower.jpg" alt="sedum with yellow flowers" %}

Watering Sedum is not overcomplicated. Ensure you water the plant when the topsoil is dry, and you should be good to go. Don’t be too afraid of underwatering it, because it tolerates drought. If you overwatered it, replant the succulent on drier soil.

As a rule of thumb, water it every time the top 2 inches of soil seem too dry. The idea is to ensure the soil is damp but not soggy. 

The most appropriate soil to plant your Sedum is a regular cactus mix like the one mentioned in this article, which does not need to be fertilized. Proper drainage is best to grow Sedum, but growing it on poorly drained soil can also work at times. 

However, it would help if you avoided soils that remain wet for too long since being that can be harmful to your plant. Waterlogged soil tends to cause root rot which is clearly bad news.

It’s an easy-to-care plant, but it has to have its needs fulfilled in order for it to bloom. If you fulfill these needs, you’ll have the succulent blooming from June to August.

If you're wondering where you can get a sedum that will grow yellow flowers, I have you covered. You can get them

## 4. Aeonium

**Native from the Canary Islands, these succulents are different from most of the others. They don’t like hot and dry conditions under which they are dormant. Aeonium grows in regular soil and likes more water than most succulents.**

Growing Aeonium is a completely different experience than being a parent of any other succulent. It’s planted on regular soil. Moreover, their water needs are also quite different.

Unlike other succulents, don’t let the soil dry completely before watering it again. It likes to sit upon moist soil, somewhere between dry and wet.  

{% include image.html image="aeonium-yellow-flower.jpg" alt="aeonium with yellow flowers" %}

Aeonium’s light needs are also different. They’ll like exposure to high levels of sunlight with partial shade, unless the weather is too hot. If you’re growing yours indoors, place them in a spot that gets abundant levels of bright indirect light.

Even though it doesn’t like hot temperatures, it’ll also die in extreme cold. It has low frost tolerance. This means that you should move it indoors during the winter.

The Aeonium will grow in winter and spring and bloom in spring and summer. 

They are slow-growing plants and may take up to 5 years to bloom, and even if they bloom, they die after it. In the meantime, repotting them every 2 to 3 years will be enough.

The plant can grow as high as 3 feet and produce panicles of yellow flowers. They stand out from the other succulents on this list because when they bloom, they also die. 

If you want to get an aeonium for your home, look no further just get it from {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Aeonium-Succulent-Plants-Shaped-Flowers/dp/B071LNJK52" text="here"%}:

## Wrapping up 

This list has mentioned the easiest succulents to grow if you’d like to see some stunning yellow flowers. I also rated the easiness of each plant on a scale from 1 (hard) to 5 (easy). 

|  | Aloe vera  | Echeveria  | Sedum  | Aeonium  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Poisonous  | No  | No  | No  | No  |
| Easiness  | 4  | 4  | 5  | 3  |
| Light  | Full sun  | Bright & direct sun  | Direct sun  |  Full sun to partial shade |


Taking care of them in the right way and being patient will pay off since all of them except Aeonium are perennials, which means they will bloom regularly and be with you for a long time and will bloom regularly. 

Once you see your succulent’s flower the first time, you’ll get addicted to them. They are extremely pretty and will bring you satisfaction that you’ve done a good job.
