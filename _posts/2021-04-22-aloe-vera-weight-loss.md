## What benefits does Aloe vera provide for weight loss? 

Let me discuss briefly why Aloe vera should be included in your diet regularly to lose weight!

### 1. It enhances your metabolic rate

Research has shown that Aloe vera can enhance the metabolic rate in the body, thus increasing the number of calories burned all day long thereby promoting weight loss. In other words, it allows the body to burn fat. Aloe vera contains vitamin B, which transforms the stored fat into energy thus, helping you to lose weight. 

### 2. It helps maintain blood sugar level

Aloe vera can control blood glucose levels, which can contribute to losing weight. A small preparatory survey in September 2013 in Nutrition revealed higher loss of body weight in diabetic patients taking an Aloe vera gel in their diet for eight weeks than the ones who were not given supplement. Taking Aloe vera in the form of juice helps lower blood glucose and maintain cholesterol levels.

### 3. It aids digestion

Aloe vera act as a stimulant laxative that may help in digestion when taken in small amounts. A disordered intestine is usually associated with weight gain. Adequate food metabolism and optimal disposal of body waste are important to release excess fat, resulting in weight reduction.
