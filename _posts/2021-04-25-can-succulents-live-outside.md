## Introduction

Succulents are beautiful plants. Some of them have big leaves and flowers that store water. Succulents have gained a lot of popularity across the world in recent years due to their beauty and low maintenance.

People often plant succulents indoors as they require little attention. Moreover, they enhance the aesthetics of the room in which they are grown. These reasons make succulents trendy indoor plants.

**Some succulents can live outdoors without much ado. They are usually bigger than indoor succulents in size and require more sunlight and space. Some common outdoor succulents include the Hen and Chicks, Whale's Tongue Agave, Stone Crop, and Ball Cactus.**

## Qualities of Outdoor Succulents 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Did you Know?" content="In some cultures, a few succulents are considered as lucky charms for their planters." %}

There is no doubt that some succulents can live outside. Some qualities and needs make certain plants more suitable to be grown outdoors. These include:

### Bigger Size

First of all, outdoor succulents are big. They can range between 4-10 feet in size. This big size makes it impossible to plant big succulents indoors. Outdoor spaces ensure these relatively bigger plants get all the space they require. 

### Need More Sunlight

Apart from extra space, outdoor succulents need more light. Light is vital for plants as without it they can't produce energy through a process called photosynthesis.

Outdoor succulents need direct exposure to sunlight for proper growth. Therefore, such succulents cannot be placed inside as they will die in the absence of direct sunlight.

### Have the Capacity To Take In More Water

Generally, succulents need little water. This is because they store water in their leaves and stems. Indoor succulents can shed their leaves in the presence of extra water and can die.

However, outdoor succulents can take more water. This is why they thrive in outdoor conditions as rain does little harm and more good to them.

### Better Resistance to Harsher Conditions

Another essential quality of outdoor succulents is their ability to resist harsh conditions. Outdoor succulents can manage extreme weather conditions easily. They can withstand low and high temperatures, mild storms, and snowfalls.

## Common Outdoor Succulents 

Not every succulent has the qualities that make it best for outdoor plantations. Out of many succulent types that are out there, only a handful possess these qualities.

## How to Take Care of Outdoor Succulents 

Just as indoor succulents require care and attention, outdoor succulents also need care. Following are a few things you can do to make sure your outdoor plant thrives.

### Proper Watering

Although outdoor succulents can take more water than indoor plants, this does not mean you water them more often. This only means outdoor plants, if exposed to higher water levels, are more likely to withstand it than indoor plants.

Outdoor succulents also store water in their leaves and stem. This means it best to wait for the soil to dry before you water it again.

### Good Soil

Another essential care element for outdoor succulents is the soil they are growing in. Succulents like their soil dry. They also thrive in soils that have better drainage capabilities. So, you may want to plant outdoor succulents at a higher spot in your garden. This will not allow water to accumulate around your plant.
