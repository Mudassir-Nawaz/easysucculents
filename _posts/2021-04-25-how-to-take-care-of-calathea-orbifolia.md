## Calathea Orbifolia 101

The Calathea Orbifolia has made a name for itself with its unique ornamental foliage. The different colours and patterns on the leaves add an element of surprise to the succulent. While it belongs from the tropics, the succulent can sustain itself rather wonderfully indoors if you give it the proper care.

The leaves can reach a size of anywhere between 15 to 35 inches wide. If you raise it indoors, it won't grow too tall, making it appropriate as a houseplant.

### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Calathea Orbifolia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Calathea Orbifolia appreciates a moist soil that features elements that promote both moisture retention and proper drainage!" %}

**The Calathea Orbifolia requires soil that imitates tropical soil. You can create a soil mixture with two ingredients: peat or coconut fibre and permite or pumice. The plant dislikes excessively dry soil or overly wet soil, so try to find the right balance.**

Don't make the mistake of letting the soil be either too dry or too wet. Waterlogged soil can promote root rot and cause the plant to weaken. Instead, try to avoid extremes and permit the plant to be at its healthiest. You might benefit from knowing that this plant prefers a pH between 5.5 and 7.0

If you're looking for a recommendation, I can recommend one based on my vast experience with them. Here is the {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Michigan-Peat-1440-Premium-40-Quart/dp/B008JSJL3W" text="link"%}:

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Michigan Peat 1440 Baccto Lite Premium Potting Soil" link="https://www.amazon.com/Michigan-Peat-1440-Premium-40-Quart/dp/B008JSJL3W" description="I advise you to get this amazing peat-based soil mix for your Calathea!" image="premium-potting-soil-product.jpg" %}

You should consider placing pebbles at the bottom of the pot if you want to improve the soil's moisture retention. The Calathea Orbifolia plant is from a tropical climate and will appreciate the damp soil immensely.

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Calathea Orbifolia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Calathea Orbifolia requires medium levels of indirect sunlight!" %}

**The Calathea Orbifolia appreciates medium levels of indirect sunlight. In other words, it prefers partial shade. Too little sunlight will result in excessively pale foliage, and too much sunlight will lead to sunburnt leaves. Tread carefully in maintaining the correct light balance.**

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="For the best results, place the Calathea Orbifolia plant next to a window." content="While the Calathea Orbifolia is certainly used to lower levels of light than other plants, it still needs exposure to indirect sunlight. To make sure the houseplant is at its healthiest, place it near a windowsill, and you're good to go." %}

{% include image.html image="calathea-orbifolia-in-sun.jpg" alt="The Calathea Orbifolia in indirect sunlight." %}

The Calathea Orbifolia is sensitive to the levels of light you provide it. There will be a noticeable impact on the foliage, so be mindful of fulfilling its needs!

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the Calathea Orbifolia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Calathea Orbifolia loves high levels of humidity as it is a tropical plant!" %}

**The Calathea Orbifolia plant prefers at least 50% humidity. While this is not the deciding factor in the health of the succulent, it will be stronger. Consider using a humidifier if the humidity level indoors is lower than 50%.**

### 4. How Should I Water the Calathea Orbifolia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="Don't overlook the watering needs of the Calathea Orbifolia. Otherwise your plant will suffer!" %}

**The Calathea Orbifolia must be watered at least twice a week in the Summers and at least once otherwise. The plant requires damp soil, so you can put a finger in the ground to check it. Don't let the soil dry out between waterings.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="If you're not going to water your plant enough be prepared to let the foliage suffer." content="Do you want to see your Calathea Orbifolia leaves with crispy brown edges?

{% include image.html image="calathea-orbifolia-on-a-girls-head.jpg" alt="The Calathea Orbifolia on top of a girl's head." %}

Don't be careless with the watering of the prayer plant. It will not be able to stand a lack in the watering department. It originates from a very moist and humid area and can't stand a starkly different situation in your home. Try to imitate the conditions of the tropics by providing it with consistently damp soil. Please don't overdo it, as waterlogged soil is also detrimental to this plant.

### 5. How to Fertilize the Calathea Orbifolia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Calathea Orbifolia Plant requires monthly feeding especially when it is in its growing period." %}

**The Calathea Orbifolia doesn't require high levels of fertilizer to sustain itself. Light feeding every month during the growing season is enough to provide it with necessary nutrients.**

If you're going to feed the plant, be consistent with flushing the soil. If there is a high concentration of fertilizer in the soil, it can potentially burn the roots of the Calathea, which is undesirable.

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Too much fertilizer is bad news for the prayer plant." content="The Calathea Orbifolia roots aren't able to bear too much of fertilizer.
