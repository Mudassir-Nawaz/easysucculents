### 1. What is the Best Soil for the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Frizzle Sizzle or the Albuca Spiralis prefers soil that is sandy so that the bulb can adjust easily!" %}

The Frizzle Sizzle Plant appreciates sandy soil as it comes from a sandy region. The plant features an underground bulb that grows the best in soil featuring sand and loam. The plant doesn't need too much compost as it can work just fine with poor soils.

Don't worry too much about the PH of your soil as the plant isn't too fussy about it. If you have neutral or slightly acidic soil, you're good to go. Keep your nerves calm as this plant won't throw a curveball at you.

If you're feeling uncertain about the best way to approach the base soil, don't sweat it. If you invest in a high-quality succulent and cactus mix, you'll be good to go. The plant will do its best with soil that has both good drainage and aeration. Don't compromise on this part!

If you're a little unsure about which soil mix to get, I have you covered. I have significant experience dealing with succulents and, I place my trust in this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Hoffman-10410-Organic-Cactus-Succulent/dp/B0030UQLIM" text="soil mix" %} for the Frizzle Sizzle Plant:

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Hoffman 10410 Organic Cactus and Succulent Soil Mix" link="https://www.amazon.com/Hoffman-10410-Organic-Cactus-Succulent/dp/B0030UQLIM" description="I recommend this soil mix as it is perfect for succulents of all kind especially the Albuca Spiralis" image="cactus-soil-product.jpg" %}

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Don't opt for really fine sand if you're curating your own potting soil." content="It is true that your plant requires sandy potting soil. However, don't be careless with the type of sand that you get for it. The sand needs to be coarse because fine sand can be an obstacle to fast drainage. A succulent that is like Frizzle Sizzle will not be tolerant of soggy soil. Do yourself a favour and only add coarse soil that aids drainage if you're dead set to make the potting soil on your own." %}

The base soil can include sand, pumice and perlite to amplify the health of your plant. The idea is to give the plant conditions which give it the best chance at staying well. The Albuca Spiralis generally prefers soil that isn't overly moist and contains some soil.

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Frizzle Sizzle will surprise you with how well it does with partial sunlight!" %}

**The Frizzle Sizzle requires medium levels of bright indirect light, which means it will do wonders if you place it near the windowsill. For best results, always place the plant in a spot with filtered sunlight. If you don't satisfy its light needs, there will be fewer leaves shaped like corkscrews!**

Don't you just love the foliage of the Corkscrew Albuca? I wouldn't take a risk with providing the plant with lower levels of sunlight. I made the mistake of placing my plant on the desk instead of next to the windowsill. The placement severely impacted the growing speed of the plant.

{% include image.html image="albuca-spiralis-leaf.jpg" alt="An Image of the Frizzle Sizzle Plant's Leaf" %}

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Don't place the Frizzle Sizzle plant in a spot which gets low levels of light." content="The lower levels of light the Frizzle Sizzle Plant gets, the lesser curls will appear on the foliage. The growing speed is dependent on fulfilling the sunlight requirements. Don't play around with the plant and give it a good chance of thriving!" %}

Alternatively, it is vital to avoid placing the plant in direct light for too long. The leaves of the curly Albuca plant will become sunburnt. 

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Frizzle Sizzle Plant will not bother you at all when it comes to humidity." %}

**The Corkscrew Albuca or Frizzle Sizzle has average humidity needs. Anything between 30 to 45% will work just fine. The plant is drought tolerant and does not need any special efforts when it comes to humidity.**

### 4. How Should I Water the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The watering needs of the Frizzle Sizzle are somewhat unique, so pay attention!" %}

**Water the Frizzle Sizzle plant every week, especially during its growing season in winters. Ensure proper drainage in the pot as soggy soil puts the plant at risk for bulb rot. If you check the plant, it should be damp, but there should never be sitting water!**

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Waterlogged soil doesn't sit well with bulbs and can cause rotting!" content="If you aren't careful and overwater the Frizzle Sizzle plant, you will witness imminent bulb rot. Don't be careless with the plant. Always remember, it is better to underwater than overwater this plant. In other words, while you should water the plant to keep the plant moist, be a little wary at the quantity you drop in the pot!" %}

### 5. How to Fertilize the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Frizzle Sizzle Plant can deal with soil that isn't too rich with nutrients!" %}

**The Frizzle Sizzle Plant has low fertilizer needs and can survive with a monthly feeding with a diluted fertilizer solution. It is best to limit feeding to the growing season, which is winter.**

{% include image.html image="young-albuca.jpg" alt="An Image of a young Frizzle Sizzle Plant" %}

The Frizzle Sizzle Plant is kind as it doesn't bother you too much with heavy fertilizer requirements. It originates from a region where poor soil is ordinary. This fact about the quirky plant explains why it doesn't have an overwhelming need for fertilizer. 

### 6. How to Prune the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="You're fortunate because the Corkscrew Albuca doesn't really need a lot of pruning!" %}

**The only significant pruning required by the Frizzle Sizzle plant involves the flower stalks. Remove them once the flower fades. Otherwise, the plant may also surprise you with some sunburnt leaves that may require removal. Take a pair of clean scissors and remove any problematic parts!**

### 7. How to Repot the Frizzle Sizzle Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The slow-growing plant will not give you an opportunity to repot it until at least the second year of its life!" %}

**You may have to repot the Frizzle Sizzle Plant after the first two years of its life. If you're moving it to a larger pot, select one which is 2 inches larger in diameter. Be careful with the bulbs and check them for any potential rot. Remove the rotten bulbs and transfer the rest to the new pot patting it with fresh potting soil.**

When you place the bulb in the new pot, it is vital to add fresh potting soil. However, don't add too much. Try to imitate the same height at which it was planted before it was removed from the old pot. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Limit repotting to the growing season in winter. Don't repot the plant during its resting period in Autumn!" content="The Albuca Spiralis's grows in the winters and thus doesn't grow much in Autumn. If you wish to repot the Frizzle Sizzle plant, go ahead, and repot it in the winter while it is still growing. The plant adjusts better to the new environment if you do so!" %}

It is best practice to repot the Frizzle Sizzle or the Corkscrew Albuca in Winters!
