{% include image.html image="peperomia-plant-on-top-of-head.jpg" alt="An image of a Peperomia Plant on top of a head" %}

**The Peperomia is a succulent which holds water in its stems and leaves. At most, it should be watered weekly, but it can also be watered a little later. As a rule, make sure that the topsoil of the plant has thoroughly dried before the next watering. You don't need to splurge a lot of liquid on it.**

### 5. How to Fertilize the Peperomia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="You must feed the Peperomia plant every two weeks with an excellent fertilizer solution!" %}

**The Peperomia Plant reacts kindly to feeding every other week. You have to ensure you use a suitable fertilizer solution that slowly releases nutrients for the plant. At most, you can fertilize it every week in the growing season, but the standard practice is not to use fertilizers during the winter season!**

Use a clean pair of scissors or knife to cut back any problem areas. Damaged growth can be eliminated while you bring the plant to the desired size.**

The only word of caution I would offer is that you shouldn't prune it too much. After all, doing so will seriously impact growth, and your plant may fail to recover from the trauma. I don't think it is a risk worth exploring, so don't get tangled up in a mess!

### 7. How to Repot the Peperomia Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The succulent does best when you repot it after the first two or three years of its life. Do remember that the Peperomia plant loves being potbound!" %}

{% include image.html image="peperomia_macrostachya.jpg" alt="An image of a Peperomia Macrostachya Plant" %}

The plant generally adores being potbound. You shouldn't be careless with repotting it and should do it only if necessary. Another option you can explore is just pruning it to maintain a good size. Please don't experiment with your plants as it could be bad news.
