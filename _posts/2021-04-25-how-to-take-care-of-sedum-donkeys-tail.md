Here is a brief overview of the conditions needed for the plant to flourish:

- Ideal soil: Soil with a mixture of sand and loam will work well to aid in drainage and moisture retention.

- Water Requirements: Requires a thorough watering once a month if the plant is indoors. Refrain from overwatering unless you want to harm the excellent plant.
- Sunlight Requirements: Requires medium levels of indirect light or partial shade. It doesn't take in the aggressive afternoon light well! 
- Ideal Temperature: 65° to 80°F (18 °C to 26°C) 
- Humidity: Around 50%
- Ideal pH: 6.0 to 7.0
