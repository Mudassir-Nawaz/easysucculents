**The String of Dolphins plant will do well with any succulent mix which is arid. It doesn't have particular soil needs. It does need proper drainage so go for something gritty like a soil mix explicitly made for succulents or cacti.**

One of the significant problems with the String of Dolphins is that it is susceptible to root rot. In other words, if you're not careful with the soil and let it be too soggy, the plant will suffer. Do a favour to the succulent and ensure it doesn't get waterlogged.

If exposed to direct sunlight during afternoon hours, the leaves may get sunburnt. Be mindful of the placement of this plant.**

If you're wondering how much sunlight the plant should get in a day, six hours is your best bet.  The plant cherishes both warmth and light.

{% include quote.html quote="The String of Dolphin doesn't really need to be repotted often!" %}

**The plant is a slow-grower and won't need to be repotted until the second or third year of its life. When you need to repot it, try to remove the plant from the pot by digging on the side. Check the root and if it is brown, remove the soil. Next, you can place it in its new pot and cover it with potting soil.**
