### 5. Sempervivum

{% include image.html image="sempervivum.jpg" alt="Sempervivum purple flowers image" %}

| Specie Name     | Sempervivum                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Common members  | House leeks, Hens and Chicks,Sempervivum arachnoideum |
| Native Area     | Southern Europe and Mediterranean islands.            |
| Plant Type      | Succulents,Perennial, evergreen rosettes              |
| Blooming Season | Summer, Fall                                          |
| Sun Condition   | Full Sun/Partial shade                                |

Sempervivum is a range of evergreen rosettes that are known to thrive even in the coldest or the hottest temperatures. Sempervivum literally means **"Live forever"** making them the perfect plant for beginners. Similarly, a member of Sempervivum known as Hens and chicks are known to have an invasive sort of spreading speed and, the chicks/offsprings that evolve from the mother plant surround the main plant. Thus, making this species of succulents truly immortal.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Fun Fact" subtitle="" content="Sempervivum 'Raspberry ice'  a variant of Sempervivum can have a life expectancy of about 20 years, it provided with the right care" %}

Sempervivum is monocarpous species in which the hen/mother plant dies after flowering. But by then, it has spread its offsprings which then carry on the mother's legacy.

These need full sun and well-drained soil to grow properly. They can even thrive on little or no water and are very sturdy plants that can withstand anything. 

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="" content="The only thing that might kill your Sempervivum is overwatering. So avoid it at all costs" %}

### 6. Echeveria

{% include image.html image="echeveria-taurus.jpg" alt="Echeveria plant being held by a person" %}

| Common members  | Perle Von Nurnberg, Echeveria 'Black Prince', Echeveria 'Dusty Rose',Echeveria 'Taurus' |

| Hardiness Zone  | 9-11 (USDA)                                                                             |
| Toxicity        | Non-toxic                                                                               |
| Tolerant        | Drought, deer, rocky soil                                                               |


Nowadays, Echeveria variants are one of the most popular succulents among gardeners. These are truly gorgeous succulents that form beautiful rosettes in all sorts of varying colors and sizes. Some of its variants also resemble the shape of waterlilies or ruffled lettuce. 

Echeveria tends to do very well in a mixture of partial to full sun and is placed in sandy or well-drained soil. Like every other succulent, they should be watered only if the soil has completely dried. Fertilizers are not necessary, but if you still need one, I would recommend you go for a low nitrogen variety.

Echeveria is often confused with Sempervivum as both of them form a beautiful rosette-shaped pattern. **But how can one differentiate between a Sempervivum and Echeveria?**
You can easily check this at the time of their bloom as Sempervivum are monocarpous meaning the mother dies after flowering while in Echeveria's case, it is polycarpous and the mother plant will not die after blooming.

If you are ready to plant this beautiful succulent you can check it out on {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Costa-Farms-Succulent-Echeveria-Inspired/dp/B07BMY29NQ/" text="Amazon"%}

## Useful Tips for beginners

**You need to grow succulent in well-drained soil under partial or full sun. Water them sparingly once every 1-2 weeks in spring to autumn and once every 5-6 weeks in autumn to winter. Remember to check your succulent type and choose the ideal one for your environment. Succulent types may have different water and light requirements, so it's best to check the succulent type carefully.**

### 1. Choose the right succulents

Being a beginner, it can get quite troublesome even when dealing with low-demanding plants such as succulents. For this reason, you should check the succulent label and choose the right succulent for your home. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Note" subtitle="" content="Read the plant label carefully as it will help you determine the succulent's needs such as light required, water needed, size and spread of the succulent " %}

Some succulents are known to thrive only under the full direct sun and, it makes them the perfect choice for outdoors. Succulents like the {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-take-care-of-string-of-hearts" text="String of hearts" %}, {% include link-internal.html link="how-to-take-care-of-string-of-pearls" text="String of pearls" %} prefer a bit of shade and will thrive indoors.  

### 2. Choose the Right Pot and Perfect Soil 

In the 2nd step, you need to make sure the pot you are providing to your succulent ensures proper drainage and has a drainage hole. If you are wondering how to fix such an environment for your succulent? Then for this case, I would recommend you to use this amazing {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Elly-D%C3%A9cor-Planter-Drainage-Saucer/dp/B08K3X7M2J" text="Amazon product"%} with a drainage saucer to create a well-drained soil, ideal for most succulents.

Similarly, for outdoor soil conditions, you should first check the soil's drainage condition, by digging a hole of about 30cm and filling it with water. You should come back after half an hour and, if the water's dried up, that means the soil is well-drained. But, if the water is still standing then you should add a mixture of 7cm of sand or other gritty material to increase the texture and drainage of the soil.

### 3. Light conditions

Succulents tend to do very well under the direct sun. On average, a succulent requires about **3-4 hours** of direct sun daily, and if the succulents don't get enough light, they tend to get weak, start {% include link-internal.html link="why-is-my-succulent-uprooting" text="uprooting" %} and get stretched. Therefore, based on the succulent type, try to provide them with as much direct sun as they need.

For indoor conditions, if you notice any of the symptoms mentioned above then you need to shift your succulent to a window or a place where it can get appropriate sunlight. If that's not possible, you can try using a bright LED or CFL light, like this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/AeroGarden-45w-Grow-Light-Panel/dp/B0725QBG1G/ " text="45 w LED grow light"%} available at Amazon.

### 4. Keep Grooming your Succulents

Succulents can get damaged by insects and pests. So, you should keep a close eye on your succulent and be sure to remove any dead leaves, standing water, or rotten leaves that might attract pests.

{% include warning.html title="Caution" subtitle="" content=" Overwatering succulent is the lead cause of root rot and pest attraction" %}

If your succulent has become infested with pests and you need a solution, then I would recommend that you rinse the succulent with insecticidal soap such as {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Safer-Brand-Insecticidal-Pyrethrin-Concentrate/dp/B00BIDYQCG/" text="Safer Brand Insecticidal"%}. After rinsing it with soap and letting it dry for about a day. During this period, you need to protect the succulent from direct sunlight to avoid sunburn. 

{% include warning.html title="Note" subtitle="" content=" It may take several attempts to completely git rid of these pests" %}
