## Introduction

The concept of fairy gardens has been around for many decades. Based on the centuries-old myth, fairy gardens can be your thing even if you do not believe in fairies (but if you do, then it is even better). If you are one of the people intrigued by the name fairy garden, you will be even more delighted to know what it is. 

**A fairy garden is a miniature version of a garden for fairies. It contains small plants that are grown around other tiny elements like huts, roads, and benches. It is usually built around a theme and tells the story of its inhabitants: fairies.**

**A fairy garden is a miniature garden that flaunts small plants and is often decorated with other miniature huts, roads, and benches. They are usually decorated with a theme in mind and may be display elements of a fairytale.**

Fans of fantasy movies and their children love fairy gardens. These beautiful spaces remind them of fairytales and Disney movies that they adore. Fairy gardens offer a perfect opportunity to make children passionate about gardening. That being said, adults enjoy making fairy gardens as much as children since it is a way to express their imagination.

## Location: Where to make your fairy garden?

**You can make your fairy garden anywhere: indoors or outdoors. The place should be big enough so that you can put your fairy garden container in.**

Building a fairy garden does not require a lot of space; all it needs is a whole lot of imagination and a little bit of dedication. It can be built in any area that you have. Be it outdoors in your garden, backyard, patio, or even indoors in your living room. 

So even if you do not have a backyard, you can build your fairy garden inside your home. The tiny space it occupies is perfect for apartment dwellers and condo owners with a knack for gardening. The location that you choose will decide what kind of plants you will grow in your fairy garden.

## Theme: What do you relate to?

*So, the first step is picking out a theme.* Your fairy garden is supposed to tell a story, and you are the storyteller. So think about something that you love and build your fairy garden according to it so it can bring a smile to your face every time you look at it. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Here's an idea!" subtitle="" content="If you cannot decide which theme to choose, look back at your favorite childhood fairytale and build your fairy garden based on that." %}

Here are some ideas you can pick from:
- Woody Wonderland
- Medieval Castle
- A Day at the Beach
- Urban Landscape
- English Cottage 
- Dark Forest 

Whichever theme you choose will help you to pick out the other accessories. So the theme is the most important and the most fun part of this process. **Use your childhood imagination! Remember, you are only limited by the boundaries you choose to put around your imagination. The only rule is that there are no rules.**

## Components: What to put inside your fairy garden? 

After you are done picking out a theme, you need to start making your garden. It is an easy process, so even if you are a beginner at gardening or are thinking of making a fairy garden with children, you are good to go.

Here is everything you need to know about **how to make your fairy garden?**:

### Container:

Pick out a large container to house all the elements that you want to fit inside it. A container should be according to the theme and available space. 

{% include image.html image="garden-container.jpg" alt="A container large enough to fit all the elements yet small enough to fit in a small space." %}

Make sure your {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Classic-Home-Garden-9010D-377R-Weathered/dp/B07L68SZK9" text="container" %} is deep enough to put soil in it and grow plants. It should have drainage holes at the bottom so your plants can flourish in adequately watered soil.

### Soil:

When you make your fairy garden, the first thing you need to do is make the land for your scenery. Moreover, the plants that you will add need soil as an anchor to grow. Choose a good quality potting soil that enables good drainage so that your plants can thrive.

You can use small pebbles, gravel, or even glass marble to make roads in your garden where your fairies can walk. Another great idea is to make a small porch area with these elements.

### Buildings:

One of the first things you need to put inside your garden are buildings for its inhabitants. You can put castles, huts, cottages, houses, and anything that suits the theme of your garden. 

{% include image.html image="fairy-house.jpg" alt="A white and pink fairy house for a Disney princess-inspired fairy garden" %}

You can even make these buildings with clay or buy these from your local store or online: 

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Miniature Fairy Garden Fairy House Statue" link="https://www.amazon.com/Top-Collection-Miniature-Terrarium-Mushroom/dp/B00JEMWY6S" description="Add this fairy house to your garden so that fairies can come and live in it" image="amazon-house.jpg" %}

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Fairy Garden Forest Figurine, Fairy House" link="https://www.amazon.com/Fairy-Garden-Forest-Figurine-Miniature/dp/B08T8KJKXS" description="This beautiful hut will be a great addition to your forest-inspired fairy garden" image="amazon-hut.jpg" %}

### Aquatic elements:

You need to add some water bodies to make your fairy garden a complete fairyland. You can add lakes, ponds, rivers, and even oceans, of course, keeping in mind the theme of your garden all along. You can even build small trenches with little bridges on top. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Create a water-like effect" subtitle="" content="Take a blue cup and put it inside the soil. This will give a realistic effect of actual lakes and ponds." %}

Here are some things that you can buy on amazon for this purpose:

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Miniature Fairy Garden Bridge" link="https://www.amazon.com/Top-Collection-Miniature-Terrarium-Cobblestone/dp/B01J24AP86" description="This bridge is a perfect addition to your fairy garden and will enhance the beauty of water flowing under it." image="amazon-bridge.jpg" %}

### Plants:

Choose the right size of plants for your container. Leafy plants are essential for your garden to look like an actual garden. You can prune some plants to look like tiny trees. Planting colorful flowers here and there will add color to your garden and make it look more beautiful than ever.

The right choice of plants will depend on whether you are keeping your garden indoors or outdoors. Whichever the case, **choose your plants according to the amount of sunlight they will be receiving: full, partial, or none.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Do not overcrowd your container." content="You want all of the plants to get proper space for themselves. Leave space for other things, and if you feel the need, you can add more plants later." %}

Think about getting small potted plants so you can put the pot inside the soil. Moreover, low-growing plants will work best because they will be proportionate in size to the rest of the garden.

### Succulents:

Succulents are a must-have in your fairy garden. They are easily maintained, and you can choose to grow them both indoors and outdoors, according to where you decide to put your fairy garden. They are compact, so they will not take up much space. Moreover, {% include link-internal.html link="most-exotic-succulents" text="the different shapes and sizes" %} of succulents will add an impressive touch to your garden.

### Dolls:

Last but not least, you need to add life to your fairytale. The elaborate scene that you made needs to have inhabitants. Dolls can be anything that is a part of your theme, like animals, humans, birds, etc.

### Miscellaneous:

To make your fairy garden as realistic as possible, you need to have other tiny miscellaneous elements to complete your storyline. For this purpose, you can add a variety of miscellaneous elements to your garden. Do not hesitate to add anything you want to add. Think about your story and imagine what the fairies would love to do in their free time. Some ideas include fountains, wells, benches, chairs, and teacups.
