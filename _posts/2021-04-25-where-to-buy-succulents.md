## All You Need to Know About Succulents

{% include image.html image="green-succulents.jpg" alt="bunch of healthy succulents" %}

Although popular in demand, some people are still unaware of what succulents are. This part of the blog tells you everything you need to know about succulents.

Succulents are unique plants, having thick and fleshy leaves that can store water. The thickness of leaves differs among different types of succulents. This ability to hold water enables them to survive in droughts. 

However, just like all other plants, they also need a good water supply for healthy growth. Succulents cannot tolerate extreme cold as well as humidity. They grow better in warmer temperatures. The reason being, with water stored in their leaves, freezing would kill them. Moreover, continuous exposure to water may also cause their roots to rot and die.

Succulents tend to change color in extreme situations such as very high exposures to sunlight or a continuous lack of water and sunlight. They may change to a pinkish or dull green color under such circumstances.

## How are Succulents Beneficial?

{% include image.html image="succulents-in-pots.jpg" alt="multiple succulents in pots" %}

Apart from decoration purposes, succulents offer many other benefits as well. Read on to know how succulents contribute to the well-being of your home and your health.

### 1. They Brighten Up Your House

These plants can brighten any environment they are kept in. They blossom at room temperatures and contribute to your home's scenic view.

### 2. Help in the Purification of Air

One of the most surprising features of succulents is that they purify the air. They do this by pulling down contaminated air and converting it into their food. The pumping force created by the emission of water vapors by the plants leads to the occurrence of this process.

This way, the air in your home is purified, and all the harmful compounds are removed.

### 3. Positively Contribute to your Home's Humidity

Succulents can do this by releasing water and thus increasing moisture in the atmosphere. This increase in humidity provides a healing effect to some common health conditions such as coughing, cold, and skin dryness.

### 4. Increased Oxygen Supply

Succulents add an extra layer of oxygen. Contrary to other plants, at night, succulents keep producing oxygen rather than carbon dioxide, providing a continuous oxygen supply. This helps in freshening the air around you. You can place these plants in places you feel like there might be a need for extra fresh air, such as your kitchen or bathrooms.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Did You Know?" subtitle="" content="According to the CDC reports, the percentage of children in America having ADHD is 11%. It is said that these plants can improve the focus of children by providing continuous exposure to nature." %}

### 5. Natural Healing Effects

It is usually said that nature has a healing effect. As per the research of Horticulture Therapy, having succulent plants at home can serve as medication and relieve your pain.

### 6. They Benefit the Human Memory

Another amusing benefit of succulent plants is the enhancement of your memory. Interaction with plants often seems to have cognitive benefits. This interaction can happen through a mere walk around greenery or even having succulents at home.  

The positive impact plants have on human memory has widely been witnessed. Enhanced memory due to succulents leads to outstanding performances in one's practical life. Hence, placing succulents in places like libraries and workplace is always an excellent idea.
