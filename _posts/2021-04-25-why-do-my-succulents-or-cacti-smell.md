Most succulents don't usually have a smell; however, some do.

The smell of succulents is primarily due to their flowers. Hence, when in the growing phase, you won't sniff anything odd in them, but they will smell sweet as soon as they begin to bloom.

This is typically the case in succulent species like Lithops and Hoyas, and some genera of cacti.

## Why Do Succulents and Cactus Smell?

If you are a plant lover, you might have noticed that some succulents produce a smell other than these beautiful fragrances. Usually, people don't find that smell good.

{% include image.html image="succulents-on-shelf.jpg" alt="An image of succulents on a shelf." %}

There could be several reasons for this kind of smell. Some of these are listed down here for you!

{% include image.html image="strong-succulents.jpg" alt="green and red succulents" %}

### 1. Root Rot

Root rots are dreadful. For someone who loves plants, root rot is simply bad news.

Since succulents are very delicate plants, root rot is a common issue they face. This issue only occurs due to irregular watering patterns or lousy drainage. 

Although succulents require less watering as compared to other plants, extensive watering can invite root rot. Once they start to rot, succulents start giving off a rotten egg-like smell.

The rot can then spread all around the plant body if not taken care of, causing the succulent to die eventually. It is thus, imperative to keep a check on your succulents for any root rots, and in case you find one, you may have to carry out surgery to remove it.

### 2. The Emergence Of Fungus Gnats In Your Soil

Before growing plants in your homes, ensure there is an excellent drainage system available.

Indoor plantations usually lack the resources required for better nourishment of plants; thus, even the slightest of inconveniences and shortfalls can have drastic effects on the growth of your succulents.

The absence of a good drainage system will result in soil being exposed to water for a more extended period, prompting the emergence of fungus gnats.

Moreover, your succulents may as well catch root rot due to continuous exposure to water which can cause significant harm to them.

### 3. The Smell Caused By Pet Urination

Urination by pets can also be one of the reasons why succulents and cacti smell. Make sure to place your plants in a place where your pets or other animals cannot reach them.

You may be confused why your succulents continue to smell bad even though they seem to be in good condition. Check if pet urination is the cause, if not, then there may be another alarming reason.

### 4. Excessive Use of Compost in Succulent Plantations

It is not compulsory to use compost when raising succulents as succulents are prone to thriving in drought and nutrient-deprived soil conditions.

It is often seen that the use of compost harms the plant rather than benefiting them. This is due to a lower level of drainage and aeration of the soil. Also, you might want to avoid compost due to its stinky smell.

People usually make their composts using various greeneries, which produces a sewage-like smell. So, be sure to use the right and balanced ingredients for making the compost.

## Some Succulents Produce A Foul Smell Naturally

Succulents produce a fancy delightful smell during their flowering season. However, some of the succulents tend to radiate an awful smell which you would want to avoid.

How bad the smell seems may vary from person to person as one may find it unbearable while the other may not be bothered about it.  

People have different perspectives regarding scents. You and I may have different views on a particular scent too.

An example is Crassula Muscosa. Some people find its smell quite irritating and unbearable, while some claim that they are unbothered with the scent and find it pleasing. You can see the plant below:

{% include image.html image="crassula-muscosa.jpg" alt="An image of Crassula Muscosa" %}

In conclusion, how good or bad a smell is, depends on the smell sensitivity a person has. And that may vary from person to person.

## Solutions to Getting Rid of This Smell

Nobody likes a smelly plant. Are you looking for ways to get rid of the foul smell from your succulents?

Methods for the removal of this foul smell vary according to the causes behind it. If the smell is due to the rotting of the root, you will need to remove the infected part using a sterilized knife.

It would help if you looked for any discolorations on the cactuses using gloves.

It is crucial for soil mix to be drainage-friendly. If it is not, determine the time it would take for drying up the soil. Use either the moisture meter or insert a toothpick to check for moisture.  

Consider changing the soil mix if it is taking longer for the soil to dry up. The ideal soil mixes for succulents have large amounts of inorganic components and have a great drainage system.

Change the soil mix if the foul smell is caused due to the excess use of compost.

If you're confused, I recommend you buy this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Hoffman-10410-Organic-Cactus-Succulent/dp/B0030UQLIM" text="soil mix" %} for your succulents and cacti:

If you find your succulent producing a smell naturally, you can either place it outdoors to avoid the smell in the house or gift the plant to someone who doesn't find the smell bothering.

To plant your succulents, you can also use gritty soil mixes. Succulents usually flourish in these.

## Checklist to Prevent Your Succulents From Smelling Bad

{% include image.html image="small-succulents-pots.jpg" alt="small succulents in a pot" %}

If you want to make sure that your succulents stay fresh and don't smell bad, ensure that they receive proper exposure to direct or indirect sunlight to enable healthy growth.

Succulents love sunlight. They should be daily provided with 4-6 hours of sunlight exposure. You can put them on windows facing the sun. Adequate exposure to the sun will also speed up the drying of the soil.

Succulents and cacti should be grown in a location having an excellent drainage system. You can either use the cactus mix soil to grow them or make a soil mix with inorganic compounds yourself.

While buying succulents, make sure you know the smell it gives off, as some succulents naturally give off a bad smell.

It is recommended to transplant the succulents to a new pot after their purchase as you may be bringing in a pest manifested soil that can infect other pots.

Astonishingly, unlike other plants, under watering does not harm succulents as much as overwatering does. Please wait for the soil to dry up completely before watering it again.

## Treatment of Rotten Cactus and Succulent

Treatment of rotten plants becomes difficult if succulents begin to produce a foul smell. Rotten roots may cause the smell, and a more intense odor may indicate that other plant parts are also rotten.

The rotted plants produce a smell similar to mold and rancid peanut butter.

If your succulents are rotting, you should scrap them from the ground and place them in isolation. This way you can take care of them better. The rots are usually brown and can cause the withering of hair and spines.

The cacti spines, which are exposed to moist soil and water, are the ones most affected. You may not be able to save your plant if the base of the plant providing support to the body has been rotten. However, if that's not the case, remove the dirt from the part infected and clean it up.

For cleaning the rot, you will need 2 to 3 q-tips, water, and an anti-bacterial soap such as SoftSoap.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Point to Note!" subtitle="" content="Make sure to not use the same q-tips for cleaning different parts of the plant as this may cause the rot to spread throughout the plant and you will then not be able to save it!" %}

You should mix the anti-bacterial soap in water, dip the q-tip into the solution, and clean the infected area gently.  After that, throw that q-tip away and use another one for further cleaning.

If you find molds emerging at the bottom of the roots, make sure to cut them. Before planting the succulent again, ensure that the base has dried up and that the infected area is not covered in soil. Replant your succulent in new soil to avoid further infection.

{% include image.html image="succulents-in-hands.jpg" alt="An image of succulents in hands." %}

When you replant the succulent, do not water it for at least two weeks. This is because the plant is dormant and will heal itself. After a month, you will find new scar tissue developed at the infected part of the plant. You can then start watering the plant and covering it with more soil.

Follow these steps, and your succulent and cactus will survive!
