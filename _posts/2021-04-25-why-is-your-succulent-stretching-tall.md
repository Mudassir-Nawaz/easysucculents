## Introduction

There is no doubt that succulents are beautiful. You might have got one for your room or garden to make the space more attractive. But now, the extra stretching of your succulent is making you worried. 

Well, there is nothing to worry about if you see your plant stretch. I will tell you the most common reasons why this may be happening. I will also brief you on how you can prevent abnormal growth on your plant.  

**Insufficient sunlight stretches your succulent. The process of thinning of leaves and elongation of the succulent stem is called etiolation. Etiolation cannot be reversed. It can only be prevented by placing your succulent in a spot with adequate sunlight.**

## The Lack of Sunlight is Making your Succulent Stretch Taller

Sunlight is very important for plants. It helps them in a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into energy. This resultant energy is fuel for the plants.

Just as other plants, succulents need sunlight for photosynthesis as well. If they do not get enough light, they get pale and thin. Apart from this, the stem of succulents also starts to elongate, stretching the plant taller than normal. The process of elongation of succulents due to lack of sunlight is called etiolation.

### 1. Lack of Sunlight and Drying of Succulent Leaves: The First Stage

The immediate effect of lack of sunlight comes in the form of drying of leaves. When this happens, the process of photosynthesis halts. This halt results in a shortage of energy. The absence of necessary energy makes the plant weak, pale, and dry.

So, if your succulent is looking pale, it can be a possible first step towards the issue of etiolation. This point is a good signal that it is time for you to bring your plant under some sunshine.

### 2. Less Sunshine and Etiolation: The Second Stage

If your succulent is not getting enough light for many days, the next step is etiolation. Etiolation is the elongation of the stem. It is a defence mechanism of the plant. Succulent uses it to stretch its leaves to increases the chances of getting light.

{% include quote.html quote="After the drying of leaves, etiolation is the next step. Etiolation refers to the elongation of the succulent stem in the absence of sunlight." %}

During this process, the plant elongates and gets taller. The leave density decreases drastically. The leaves of the plant get pale. And the plant starts to lose its natural shape and form.
