## Introduction

Big or small, cacti can fit in any space at all. No wonder it makes them such a popular indoor plant choice. Not only do they shine in the sun, but they can thrive indoors too. They’re my number one choice when I need to enhance the aesthetics of my home. The best thing about them is that they are easy to care for.

**Cacti plants grow well in a temperature ranging between 45 °F to 85 °F (7°C to. 29 °C). They require bright light, infrequent watering, and humidity levels between 45% and 60%. Indirect light is sufficient for cacti that grow indoors.**

- Water Requirements: Very low. Only need water when the base of the soil runs dry.
- Sunlight Requirements: Indirect but bright sunlight for cactus grown indoors.
- Temperature: 45 °F to 85 °F (7°C to. 29 °C)
- Humidity: Between 40-60%
- Ideal pH: 5-6.5 pH (Acidic)
- Frost-Resistance: Low, should be brought indoors when it is cold outside.
- Fertilizer: Very low feeding need.
- Pruning: You can easily tear off offsets or pups, or use a trimmer. Use a sharp knife to cut the main stalk.
- Propagation: Easily propagated using their pups, cutting and grafting.
- Repotting: Use a slightly bigger pot than the cactus plant.
- Toxicity: Some species can be poisonous but mostly cacti are not toxic.

### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Cactus?

{% include quote.html quote="Give your cacti plants well-drained, acidic soil. They'll thank you for it!" %}

**Cacti plants thrive well in well-drained soil. The perfect soil mix for a cactus is half organic and half inorganic. It will need a mixture that is both sandy and slightly moist.**

Inorganic substances help keep the soil less moist and drier. For instance, perlite can offer more drainage and keep the soil airy too. You can also use the regular potting mix and fill it with inorganic material. However, it is not recommended.

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Cacti love light but be careful not to give them too much of it!" %}

**Cacti plants are best kept in a well-lit space. However, direct sunshine should be avoided at all costs. Depending upon the species, some cacti even thrive in partial shade.**

{% include image.html image="cacti-in-bright-light.jpg" alt="Cacti indoors in bright light by the window" %}

You may be tempted to place your cacti in direct sunlight. After all, they’re desert plants, right? But they can get sunburned. Desert cacti have different adaptations that help them survive in the harsh sun. For your indoor cacti plants, the situation can be very different.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="" content="Cacti can only thrive in full sunlight if there is plenty of air around them!" %}

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="You may have to adjust the humidity levels for your cacti plants to thrive!" %}

**Cacti need humidity levels between 40-60% to flourish.  If you live in a region with lower humidity, keep misting your plant.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Water your plant carefully to maintain humidity!" content="Remember that cacti plants are a fan of dry soil. The best way to control humidity is only by misting. Do not attempt to water your plant to make it moister!" %}

### 4. How Should I Water Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Your cacti plants need minimum water, only when they run dry!" %}

**Cacti plants are known to thrive in the hottest temperatures. Neither water them too much, nor too little. Always check the base soil to see when you should water the next.**

**For Summer:**
Your cacti plants need to be watered after every 10 days or two weeks. At times, you can also water it once a week.

**For Winter:**
You don’t need to water it much. Do it only if you notice a change in the plant’s shape. You can also keep a check on the soil instead. Slightly mist or water a bit when the base is completely dry.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Check the soil before you water." content="Always check the base of the soil to know that it is completely dry!" %}

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="This is when you must water your cactus!" content="Check the bottom of your cactus plant to see if it’s running too dry. If it’s withering, then you may need to give more water than usual." %}

### 5. How to Fertilize Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Cacti plants do not need fertilizers except in the growing season!" %}

**If you’re using fertilizer, make a proper schedule for your plant. Feed it once a year at most. Or if you want, you can do it seasonally. For instance, once in the summer and once in the winter. In other words, you can feed it twice a year!**

You should only fertilize your cacti during the growth season. I personally recommend that you use {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Gro-Succulent-Plant-Succulents-including/dp/B082BP86KS" text="this fertiliser for your cacti."%}

### 6. How to Prune the Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Cacti plants do not always require pruning unless there’s a reason!" %}

**Pruning is not generally required for cacti. If you see your cactus dying, you should immediately prune its pups.**

{% include image.html image="cactus-with-scissors.jpg" alt="Cactus ready for pruning" %}

### 7. How to Repot Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Cacti plants need to be repotted if they’re getting larger than their current pot!" %}

**Repot your container when the roots begin to outgrow the container. Never let your cactus grow bigger than its pot. This can cause it to become rootbound. You can use an old container but use a new and fresh soil mix.**

Carefully take your cactus out of the pot. If it doesn’t come out easily, you can use a spade. Once the plant is out of its pot, you will have to remove the soil. Again, you can use a spade or a trowel if the plant resists. But remember to be gentle!

When you have the plant in your hand, put it into the new container. Do not water the plant immediately. Let it become familiar with the new soil first. It is best to wait for a couple of days before you begin to water your cactus.

## Things You Should Know About Cacti Plants

### 1. How to Propagate Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="There are many simple ways to propagate cacti plants. Depending on the species and growth of your plant, choose the right one!" %}

**Using Pups and Offshoots**

Your cacti plant pups are the baby cacti you see growing at the top. They can also be surrounding your cacti plants. Here’s the good news. You can propagate each pup! Place each pup in a pot containing a cactus mix. These pups don’t have to be rooted deep. They will reach out for the soil themselves.

{% include image.html image="cactus-many-offsets.jpg" alt="A cactus with many offsets" %}

**The Cutting Method**

This method works the best if your cactus is tall. Cut with a sharp knife. Plant the freshly cut cactus into another soil. New pups will root out from where you have sliced the parent cactus. As for the new one, wait and watch till it grows tall!

**Grafting**

Not all cacti plants are propagated by cutting or using pups. For instance, moon cacti need can only be propagated by grafting. For grafting the moon cactus, you remove the upper portions. These pups cannot be planted on their own.

You will need to slice another cactus in half. Then place these pups on top of them. This is because the moon cactus flowers cannot make their food. They need a stem to survive!

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Do not water tiny pups immediately." content="Always mist before you begin to water recently planted pups." %}

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Be clear about where you are making the cut!" content="Some cacti pups come out easily using the hand. But it’s recommended to use a sharp knife to cut them off. Make sure you don’t harm the parent plant! Always cut at a slanted angle." %}

### 2. How Toxic are Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Not all cacti plants can be toxic, save a few!" %}

**Some cacti species can be poisonous. They produce sap that can irritate both your skin and eyes. But all in all, cacti are safe for you and your pets.**

{% include image.html image="cactus-and-cat.jpg" alt="Cactus with a cat nearby" %}

The good news is that not all cacti species are poisonous. You may find that there are only a number of them. For the safe cacti plants, you can even eat their fruits (Or drink their juice too!)

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Handle cacti with care when you are touching them!" content="The spines and thorns of your cacti plants may carry bacteria. If your skin gets punctured, you may catch an infection!" %}

### 3. What are Common Issues with Cacti Plants?

{% include quote.html quote="Keep an eye on the color of your cactus, it will speak volumes to you!" %}

**A cactus begins to bend if a part of its stem has become infected. You can use a stone to support a cactus that has started to lean. It may retain its shape but the problem can be serious if the infection spreads!**

**When Your Cactus Begins to Decay or Rot**

If your cactus is rotting, it’s either getting no water or too much of it. Your cactus may also appear shaky like it’s about to fall. Gently touch to see if the cactus is shaking.

**When Your Cactus Starts Turning Red**

Your cactus plant can get sunburned from too much exposure to sunlight. When that happens, the cactus starts turning red. If you notice a tinge of red, move your cactus to a new spot immediately.

**When Your Cactus Starts Turning Yellow or Brown**

This is one of the major issues of cacti. If your cactus is turning yellow or brown, it needs light. Move your cactus to a space where there is bright light. Remember that this needs to be indirect.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Recognizing the ‘brown’ of your cactus!" content="Not every brown color means that your cactus is dying. It may be aging instead. A cactus that’s growing old will also have a grayish tone to its skin." %}

**Diseases and Infections Caused by Pests**

Make sure you keep a check on pests. Some pests that love to attack cacti are scales, mealy bugs and root mealy bugs.

Scales can be removed instantly. With their hard shells, they can even look like snails. So try to spot them out well!

Can you see white long strips running across the soil of your cactus? Those are mealybugs. Both mealybugs and scales can be removed using alcohol.

Spider mites can also take your cacti down. They suck out all the juice, making the cactus weak. You can use a strip of paper to get rid of dust and these mites.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="It’s easy to make your very own pest disinfectant!" content="You can also use a dish detergent with water to remove all types of pests." %}

## Conclusion

While there are many cacti species, their caring factors are quite common. Keep your cacti plants in a bright space with indirect sunlight. Water them only when its base soil is dry to the touch. If humidity is lower than 40 percent, moist your cactus. And remember that they thrive in a temperature ranging between 45 °F to 85 °F (7°C to. 29 °C).
