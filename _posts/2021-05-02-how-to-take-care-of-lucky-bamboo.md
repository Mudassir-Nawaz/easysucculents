### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Lucky Bamboo Plant?  

{% include quote.html quote="The Lucky Bamboo loves well-drained yet moist soil!" %} 

**The Lucky Bamboo can grow both in soil and water. For soil, it needs to be well-drained with slight moisture. When grown in water, have at least an inch of the roots submerged in water.**  

When grown in water, you need to take care of regular cleaning and changing. A lucky bamboo growing in water will not require frequent misting! 

{% include image.html image="lucky-bamboo-in-water.jpg" alt="A lucky bamboo growing in water" %} 
  
### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Lucky Bamboo?   

{% include quote.html quote="Exposing the plant to indirect sunlight is the best way to keep your Lucky Bamboo healthy!" %}   

**Filtered sunlight is the best for your Lucky Bamboo. Being a tropical plant, direct sunshine can make the lucky bamboo dry.**  

You can get filtered, indirect sunlight through:

- A curtain 
- A canopy 
- A spot where the sunlight doesn't hit the plant directly! 

Indoors, it’s best to keep your Lucky Bamboo near the east. These tropical plants are used to low-light conditions. So artificial light works equally well for them. To track lighting conditions, keep a check on the leaves. If you find them turning yellow, your lucky bamboo needs more light. Improper lighting will also block its growth or any new leaves from sprouting.  

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Save your lucky bamboo from getting burnt!" content="Never place your Lucky Bamboo in direct sunlight. It will burn its leaves." %} 

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the Lucky Bamboo? 

{% include quote.html quote="The Lucky Bamboo needs a very high humidity of more than 50%." %} 

**Don’t try to work too much on the humidity and temperature of your lucky bamboo. It can thrive indoors at regular room temperature. Mist the plant with some filtered water whenever you find it running dry.** 

{% include pro-tip.html title="Low humidity? Not a problem!" subtitle="" content="When planted in soil, you can keep misting the lucky bamboo for higher humidity levels!" %} 

### 4. How Should I Water the Lucky Bamboo? 

{% include quote.html quote="The Lucky Bamboo should neither be too dry nor be watered too much!" %} 

**The Lucky Bamboo enjoys a moist environment. It prefers to have well-drained soil. But along with moisture.** 

**If your Lucky Bamboo is growing in soil**  

You can water your lucky bamboo with tap water. But with precautions! Tap water consists of chlorine and other chemicals that can be harmful to your sensitive Lucky Bamboo. Along with chlorine, tap water also contains fluoride. Both these chemicals are harmful for your lucky bamboo. Always water your plant with water that is at room temperature. Cold water is a big no! 

Things can be different if you’re growing your lucky bamboo in water. If you don’t have another container for your plant, you will need to wash it regularly.  

**If your Lucky Bamboo is growing in water**   

You must regularly:  

- Take out the Lucky Bamboo from the vase or container 
- Use a mixture of warm water and liquid soap to wash the container 
- Clean it properly and fill it with at least 1-2 inches of new water  
- Put your Lucky Bamboo back into the vase   

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Be cautious of the water you're using!" content="When using tap water, don’t do it immediately. You must keep it aside for chemicals like chlorine to leave. Take out some water in a separate container. Then leave it for 24 hours." %}   

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Be careful when growing your lucky bamboo in water!" content="You can even grow your lucky bamboo entirely in water. Just remember to change the water regularly." %} 

### 5. How to Fertilize the Lucky Bamboo? 

{% include quote.html quote="Take proper care of your Lucky Bamboo and there is seldom need of a fertilizer!" %} 

**The main nutrient needed by the Lucky Bamboo is nitrogen. You can maintain nitrogen feed via water or even use fertilizer infrequently. If you water the Lucky Bamboo well enough, you wouldn’t need to feed the plant. At most, Lucky Bamboo only needs a drop of fertilizer every month.**  

Don't put much emphasis on a fertilizer for your lucky bamboo. But if you find it is not growing well, I would suggest getting {% include link-internal.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Fertilizer-Bottles-Ready-Purpose/dp/B016CD4PDG" text="this fertilizer."%} 

{% include featured-amazon-product.html title="Bamboo Fertilizer Bootles" link="https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Fertilizer-Bottles-Ready-Purpose/dp/B016CD4PDG" description="Follow the instructions on this bottle of lucky bamboo food and you're good to go! You can also purchase the 3-bottle pack to save some cash." image="amazon-lucky-bamboo-fertilizer.jpg" %}

### 6. How to Prune the Lucky Bamboo? 

{% include quote.html quote="Leaves that become dry and yellow should be immediately pruned." %} 

**What you need to trim** 

- Stems growing in a crooked position 
- A dying stalk 
- Damaged, sunburned leaves 

Use very sharp scissors or shears to prune your lucky bamboo. Pruning the stalk of your plant can change its height. However, the leaves will grow after every pruning session.  

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Want to save your lucky bamboo leaves from turning brown?" content="If the edges of the leaves look slightly brown, your lucky bamboo is getting sunburned. Move it to an area where there is a lesser light. This will tone down the need to prune in the future." %} 

### 7. How to Repot the Lucky Bamboo? 

{% include quote.html quote="You should repot your Lucky Bamboo when the container gets too small for its growing roots." %} 

**The Lucky Bamboo needs repotting if it becomes root bound. Root bound is a condition in which many roots tightly develop around the plant.**  

**Before repotting the Lucky Bamboo** 


Dump out all the rocks. 
  

**After repotting the Lucky Bamboo**  

Cover half of the plant with plastic for high humidity levels.  

If you put it in a larger container, the roots will grow out easier. If your lucky bamboo plant is root bound, then you may need to cut the roots down. You should always leave one or two inches of roots of the lucky bamboo when you cut it.   

{% include warning.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="Don't overdo the covering!" content="Don’t overwhelm the plant by compactly covering with soil. Leave room for air in the soil as it helps avoid fungus and rotting." %}  

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="A dying bamboo plant? Repot it!" content="If your lucky bamboo is dying, repotting it in dirt can help." %} 

## Things You Should Know About the Lucky Bamboo Plant 

### 1. How to Propagate the Lucky Bamboo Plant? 
  
{% include quote.html quote="If you know how to trim from the healthy stalk, you can propagate your lucky bamboo in either soil or water!" %}  

**To propagate the lucky bamboo, you would need to cut off from a healthy stalk. Pick a leaf stalk that’s healthy and has at least two leaf joints at the bottom. This will be the growth node. You need to make the cut as close as possible to the bottom. Then, you have two choices to place your sprout. Choose between soil or water.**

| Keep it warm and moist. A lucky bamboo planted in soil will require more humidity maintenance. 	| Add rocks in the container to provide support to the stalks.            	| 

  

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Never ignore a lucky bamboo that is growing in water!" content="Keep cleaning the water regularly if you’ve propagated in water. Also, don’t use any extra chemicals to fasten the growth of your plant. Let it grow naturally." %}  

### 2. How Toxic is the Lucky Bamboo Plant? 

{% include quote.html quote="Lucky Bamboo should not be consumed by animals. For humans, it is safe." %} 

**If you have pets, keep your lucky bamboo out of their reach.**  

### 3. What are Common Issues with the Lucky Bamboo? 

Pest control is required for Lucky Bamboo. Mealybugs, mites, and fungal infections are the most common problems with this plant. 

Look out for these warning signs! 

- Black roots 
- Dead leaves immersed in water staying the pot 
- Leaves turning yellow 

**Why do the leaves turn yellow?** 

If you find the leaves of your Lucky Bamboo turning yellow, there could be many reasons. It happens due to the poor maintenance. There may be issues with: 

- The type of water you’re using 
- Not changing the water frequently 
- Placing your lucky bamboo in direct sunlight  

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Glass, light and water can be a bad combo!" content="Are you growing your lucky bamboo in water? There is more chance of algae growth when light comes in contact with water. If it's possible, don't use a transparent vessel!" %} 

**Diseases and Pests** 
  
Mealybugs, fungal infections and algae. Be very mindful if your lucky bamboo is growing in water. When light reaches the water through the glass container, algae can be born. These algae will act like poison for your lucky bamboo. 
 
## Conclusion 
  
The lucky bamboo can grow in both water and soil. It's ideal temperature ranges between 65 °F to 90 °F (18°C to. 35 °C). It needs a humidity greater than 50%. Keep misting your lucky bamboo to ensure humidity levels. Especially if it grows in soil. Since it is tropical, partial sunshine will keep it healthy.
