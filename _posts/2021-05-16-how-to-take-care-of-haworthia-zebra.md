### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Zebra Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="Your Zebra Succulent plant needs fast-draining soil with no sand." %}

**The Haworthia Zebra needs potting soil that drains fast. You can also use a cactus mix but avoid adding sand to it. Adding perlite into the mix is fine as it won’t interfere with draining.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Keep a check on the pH value of the soil!" content="The Zebra Succulent needs soil " %}

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Zebra Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="Your Zebra Succulent will love to be in bright, direct sunlight!" %}

**The zebra succulent appreciates bright and direct sunlight. It won’t thrive well in partial or full shade. They have a natural tendency to lean and grow in the shade outdoors.**

Haworthia species like bright light, but not direct sunlight. In their native environment, they are often found in the shade of a rock or other object. They do best in a room with a window facing east or west to provide bright light for a few hours a day. If the plant isn't getting enough light, its green color will fade.  

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Don’t change the environment for the plant!" content="An outdoor haworthia plant won’t survive when brought indoors. And an indoor one won't survive outdoors. Sudden change of location can cause your zebra succulent to get sunburned or wither." %}

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Is your zebra succulent losing its rich green color?" content="Are the leaves of your haworthia zebra turning yellow or white? Either change in color can mean your plant is getting more direct sunlight than required!" %}

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the zebra succulent Plant?

{% include quote.html quote="The Zebra Succulent doesn’t need extra humidity but it does need air! " %}

### 7. How to Repot the Zebra Succulent?

{% include quote.html quote="You may have to repot your haworthia zebra every four to five years!" %}

**The Zebra Plant rarely needs repotting. These succulents take a lot of time to grow. Their height can only grow at most 5 inches tall. When repotting the Haworthia Zebra, you can plant them in groups.**

Since these plants are small, use shallow pots. This will allow for easier water drainage. The growing season for the Zebra Succulent is during Spring and Summer. You can use the old pot but make sure you that the mix is completely fresh and that you change the soil.
