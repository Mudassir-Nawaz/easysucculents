## Introduction
 
The Elephant Bush or the Portulacaria Afra can grow into various sizes. This is why I prefer these succulents for almost any space in my home. I have a few mature ones that are six to eight feet tall! With proper care and maintenance, the Elephant Bush can grow as tall as 12 feet!

**The Elephant Bush needs six hours of direct sunlight, ideally with a temperature between 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 29°C). It needs watering more frequently than other succulents. Also needs well-draining soil. It is non-toxic to humans and animals. Grows well indoors at average humidity.**

An Elephant Bush Plant resembles the Jade plant. But it is quite different from one! The leaves of this lovely succulent look like an elephant’s ears which explains where it gets its name from. It is also known as the Dwarf Jade, Elephant Food or the Portulacaria Afra.

### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Portulacaria Afra?

{% include quote.html quote="Choose a well-draining succulent soil mix for your elephant bush!" %}

**The Portulacaria Afra requires a well-draining succulent soil mix. The mixture should not hold excessive moisture.**

Use a pot with drainage holes. You can also include perlite in your potting soil mix. Perlite allows for proper airflow in the soil, making the drying speed faster.

### 2. What are the Sunlight Requirements of the Elephant Bush?

{% include quote.html quote="Place your elephant bush where there’s partial shade for most hours, and direct sunlight for a few!" %}

**The Elephant Bush or the Portulacaria Afra needs at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. Intense sunlight for a long duration should be avoided. Keep in partial shade otherwise.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Keep an eye out for potential sunburns!" content="The miniature version of the Elephant Bush is intolerant of heat. It may be more prone to getting sunburned than its bigger counterpart." %}

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the Elephant Bush?
 
{% include quote.html quote="The Portulacaria Afra does not need high humidity!" %}
 
**The elephant bush is not demanding a succulent for humidity. It thrives well in room-temperature humidity.**

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Don't moisten the elephant bush!" content="The portulacaria afra requires normal humidity indoors. It is not a good idea to moisten it by spraying as it can lead to unnecessarily high humidity levels." %}  
 
### 4. How Should I Water the Elephant Bush?
 
{% include quote.html quote="It’s good to water the Elephant Bush more when there is a heatwave!" %}
 
**The elephant bush has thin leaves so it doesn’t stock much water. It must be watered every week during the Summer. Water it after every 1.5 weeks during the winter or during cooler summer temperatures.**
 
{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Do not overwater your plant!" content="Don’t get carried away with watering just because the Portulacaria has thin leaves!" %}

### 5. How to Fertilize the Elephant Bush?
 
{% include quote.html quote="The Elephant Bush has minimal fertilizer needs!" %}
 
**The Elephant Bush needs little fertilizer. You can use one available for cacti plants. Give a drop every month during the growing season from Spring to Fall.**
 
{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Don't give the plant fertilizer during winter!" content="Succulents hardly need intake during winter. That's more like their time off. They will react negatively to water with fertilizer in the cold!" %}
 
### 6. How to Prune the Elephant Bush?

{% include quote.html quote="Other than cutting off dead parts, the Elephant Bush can also be pruned for shaping!" %}

**The Portulacaria Afra must be free of moisture before pruning. Use a sharp, disinfected knife before you begin to prune. Dead stems and offsets will need to be trimmed immediately.**

You can also prune the Elephant Bush plant for stylistic purposes. Make cuts in the shape you want your Portulacaria Afra to be. If you want a miniature-sized Bonsai tree shape, you can do that too!

{% include image.html image="many_elephant_bush_leaves.jpg" alt="Many leaves of an Elephant Bush or Portulacaria Afra plant" %}

### 1. How to Propagate the Elephant Bush?
 
{% include quote.html quote="The Elephant Bush can be easily propagated by its cuttings!" %}

**You can easily use Elephant Bush cuttings for propagating. Make clean cuts using a sharp blade. Put these leaves aside to dry for propagation.**

Once the stem cuts of the leaves have dried, you have two options:

1. Put them slightly into the soil
2. Simply place them on the soil base

Here are a few tips to follow after propagating your Portulacaria Afra leaf cuttings:
- Avoid placing the pot in direct sunlight
- Keep watering minimal, only when you feel the soil is touch-dry
- You can sense the growth of roots by checking if the plant has become firm in the pot
- You can expect it to get fully rooted in around a month  

{% include warning.html title="Warning" subtitle="Never forget to sterilize your knife!" content="Whether you’re pruning or propagating, you’re making cuts. If you don’t use a sterilized knife, your plant can get infected!" %}

### 3. What are common issues with the Elephant Bush?
 
{% include quote.html quote="You need to keep an eye on the leaves of the elephant bush!" %}

**Falling Leaves**
Falling leaves of an elephant bush indicate a lack of nutrients. You can prevent falling leaves by regular use of fertilizer.

**Discolored Leaves**

Its ideal temperature is 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 29°C) and average humidity is best. You can fertilize it during the growing season and propagate it using its pups.
