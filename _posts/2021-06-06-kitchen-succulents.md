Be sure to keep your succulent hydrated. The thick fleshy leaves are the charm of the succulent. If they look limp and lifeless, they will make your whole kitchen look just as dull. However, bear in mind that most succulents do not require a lot of water. 

Do not overwater your succulent. This can often lead to plant death at times.  

## 2. Shift their position

It is important to shift the position of your succulent if it rests under shade. Most succulents require a few hours of direct sunlight. Be sure to place your succulent where it gets plenty of light like a windowsill. 

If your succulent isn't getting much light, the leaves will stretch out and become lighter in color. Trust me, that is not a sight for sore eyes. 

## 3. Use a unique planter

Succulent planters come in a variety of different shapes, colors and patterns. Be sure to get your succulent an eye-catching planter. A good planter can light up your whole kitchen.

Succulent planters can collect dust easily since they rest in one spot all day. Be sure to clean your planter with a cloth. Let's face it, no one likes to look at dusty planters. They ruin the aesthetic of your plant. 

Be sure to clean them on a regular basis.

## 5. Watch out for pests

Pests can be quite annoying to deal with when you own succulents. Common pests that attack succulents are mealy bugs. Be sure to remove dead leaves as soon as possible. Pests tend to enjoy dead leaves. 

Be sure to remove any excess water from your planter. A succulent resting in a pool of water can attract a variety of different pests. 

## 6. Use a good fertilizer

A good variety of fertilizer can encourage active growth in succulents. These succulents will grow up to their full potential. Fertilizers in turn, help succulents develop different colors.

Good fertilizers include Manure tea and Miracle-Gro Succulent plant food.

## 7. Keep their environment dry

Make sure to keep your planter and the surroundings dry. Succulents prefer hot and dry environments. They thrive in a moisture-free zone. It is best to keep your succulent in an open container where it can receive dry air.

 Moisture in the air can cause fungal disease in succulents. 

## 8. Watch out for frost

Although, a lot of indoor succulents can tolerate cold environments, it is still better to be safe than sorry. Most succulent owners have lost a succulent or two to frost at least once. Be sure to place your succulent in a spot where it receives sunlight. 

It is still not advisable to arrange a space heater for your succulent. It's better to stick to traditional methods when protecting your succulent from the cold. 

## 9. Keep them away from pests

Most succulents are always under threat of being attacked by house pets. Since your pets aren't under constant surveillance, it can seem like quite a challenge to protect your indoor succulents from them. 

Pets can not only break your planter but also consume your plant. It is best to keep it someplace that is out of their reach.
