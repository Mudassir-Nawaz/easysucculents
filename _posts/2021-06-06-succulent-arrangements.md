## Why Arrange Succulents?

Succulents come in many shapes, colors and sizes. I tend to arrange them in a variety of ways. Depending on the succulents you have, you can even plant them in hanging pots. 

**Succulents can be arranged in a variety of well-drained containers. These could include fabric sacks, tiny shells, household items, terrariums, etc. Succulent plants can be arranged in groups and patterns too. The only requirement for these plants is proper drainage.**

So as long as your succulent is getting proper drainage, any container would be good for it. Using containers other than regular pots makes both the plant and your indoor or outdoor space more aesthetically pleasing!

### 1. Succulents in tiny clams or shells

{% include quote.html quote="Do you love the sea? Plant your succulent in a shell!" %}

{% include image.html image="plant-in-shell-container.jpg" alt="A succulent in a tiny seashell-shaped container" %}

The best part is that almost all seashells have a hole to give adequate drainage to your beloved succulent plant. Get seashells of many sizes and shapes and arrange them in a pattern of your liking. Place them on the center table or at the windowsill. 

{% include warning.html title="WARNING" subtitle="One size does not fit all!" content="Only tiny or young succulents can be kept in seashells. When your succulent begins to outgrow its shell, it will need to be repotted." %}

### 2. Succulents in terrariums

{% include quote.html quote="Terrariums big or small, all look equally pretty!" %}

{% include image.html image="succulent-in-terrarium.jpg" alt="Assorted succulents in an open terrarium" %}

Terrariums are tiny glass containers for plants. Many small succulent species look twice as gorgeous when planted inside terrariums. You can take different types of succulents and place them in an array of terrariums, all ranging in sizes and shapes.

**Types of Terrariums**
While terrariums look beautiful, you’ll have to pick one based on the needs of your plant and not just for aesthetic reasons alone.

**Open Terrariums**
These terrariums are perfect for succulents that need airy and bright direct light to grow.

If you want an open terrarium, you wouldn’t want to miss this {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/WGV-Hanging-Votive-Candle-Terrarium/dp/B00OFY9WRO" text="Hanging Votive Candle Terrarium!"%}

**Closed Terrariums**
While closed terrariums look fabulous and give that ‘Beauty and the Beast’ fairytale look, not all succulents can grow well in closed terrariums. The best succulent plants for such terrariums are those that need high humidity to thrive.

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Terrariums come in a variety of fun shapes and sizes!" content="There’s more to terrariums than just circular domes. When you’re shopping for terrariums, go through the various shapes. These may include diamonds, squares, rhombus, and other fun and beautiful terrariums." %}

{% include image.html image="succulent-rollerskate.jpg" alt="Tiny succulents arranged in a roller skate" %}

Old household items like ladders or even other belongings such as roller skates can make fun containers. If you want, you can place the succulent in a regular pot and then place it inside another household item or on top of it.

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Remember succulents need drainage!" content="If your succulent can grow only in soil, there should be a hole in the bottom of the jar.

You can choose to have similar species group together, or succulents that have the same color, the same size, or even randomly. To make things more interesting, you can have a shallow dish that is hand-painted from the inside or pots painted from the outside, while keeping the dish simple.

### 18. Succulents in Translucent Bottles

{% include quote.html quote="Some succulents can grow very well in water only. Use that as an aesthetic element!" %}

Get bottles of various colors, including brown, blue, green, yellow and place them all side-by-side. Although this arrangement is not good for succulents that cannot survive in water. Lucky bamboo is one of those succulent plants that will rock this arrangement!
