Succulents typically enjoy a few hours of direct sunlight. Make sure not to keep them under the sun for excessively longer durations of time. Keep shifting their position and place them under shade for the rest of the afternoon. 

Not enough sunlight can ruin a succulent's health. It will end up looking lifeless in only a matter of days. 

## 2. Keep them in a dry place

Succulents are often not very fond of moisture and damp environments. Be mindful of a window succulent's needs. The best way to do is to observe your succulent. You have to see for yourself before you make any quick decisions. 

It has been established as a fact that succulents thrive in a hot and dry environment. Be sure to keep your window succulent away from wet surroundings.


## 3. Use a fertilizer

Fertilizers are a great way to ensure a succulent's healthy growth. Ideally, there should be a balance between a succulent's water and fertilizer intake. A slight increase or decrease in either of them can cause health problems for the succulent.  

Worms are an organic alternative to fertilizer. Worms do not only provide essential nutrients to succulents but also neutralize soil pH.

## 4. Water them regularly

Be sure to water your window succulents on a daily basis. Although, most of these succulents can survive without water for long periods of time. Be careful with overwatering. Your succulent can die if it lies in a pool of water. 

A well hydrated succulent looks beautiful with its thick and fleshy leaves. 

## 5. Choose a good drainage pot

Drainage is an important factor which ensures a succulent's healthy growth. If there is no way for water to seep out of a pot, it can cause serious damage to the roots. Getting a pot with a drainage hole will prevent overwatering problems.

Most succulents can fall prey to a variety of different pests like mealy bugs. These bugs eat away the thick leaves of the succulent. What remains is a corpse-like succulent hanging on for dear life. 

Be sure to check your window succulent for pests and keep their environment clean. 

## 7. Use the right soil mix

The type of soil you use can have a huge impact on a succulent's health. A healthy ratio of compost and sand has to be used for succulents. They typically do not require a lot of nutrients. The potting mixture does not need to be watered frequently. 

Using the right amount of organic materials in the soil mix will enable a succulent to reach full potential. Soaking up all the nutrients from the right soil mix will ensure healthy growth.

## 8. Avoid overwatering

A leading cause of unexpected death in succulents is overwatering. A lot of succulent owners do not keep a check on how much they water their plants. This can result in an excess build up of moisture which can prove to be deadly for a young succulent.

Be sure to water your window succulents only when it seems necessary. 

## 9. Get a nice planter
