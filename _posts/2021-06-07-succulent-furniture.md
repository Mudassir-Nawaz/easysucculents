## Introduction

If you are a fan of plants indoors, a great way is to plant your succulents inside the furniture (Read below to find out how) or keep the plants on the areas of furniture not occupied by other stuff. This will not only save space but also add a unique look and color to your home.

Being a desk dweller and spending a lot of time in your house can have detrimental effects on your health. By adding plants inside your house, you can bring nature to yourself and give your lungs a fresh breath of air without stepping out. Fortunately, succulents are the best plants for this purpose.

**Succulents can be planted anywhere, indoors or outdoors, and even on or in your furniture. You can plant your succulents in old furniture, or you can buy furniture with in-built planters, like coffee tables, chairs, etc.**
