faq: 
- question: is sedum high maintenaince?
  answer: These plants require very little upkeep. Simply place them in a location with appropriate soil drainage and sunlight, and they'll almost look after themselves. They don't require deadheading (the removal of spent blooms) and can last well into the winter. Extreme heat and a lack of sunshine, on the other hand, might lead sedum plants to become leggy.

- question: what is cheaper to buy succulents or seeds?
  answer: The price point of buying seeds is generally low and you have a high chance of getting your desired variety of succulent.
- question: How to take care of Kalanchoe?
  answer: It can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but will not bloom in the winter. Beginning in the spring, you'll be rewarded to bursts of colorful flowers that can last several weeks and recur throughout the year, as long as the plant gets enough light and is pruned properly between blooms by removing the flowering heads and providing only little watering for a few weeks.

## Introduction

When people think of succulents, they typically think of the stunning little rose-like plants with thick fleshy green leaves that are sometimes found in little pots on tables. Many succulent plants, such as echeverias and sedums, have a general appearance that contributes to this. There are, however, many more in a variety of sizes and shapes. 

**Succulents can be found growing wild all over the planet. Their origins determine their distinct colors, forms, and textures.**

## 1. ALOE

Most people associate aloe with a green semi-liquid thing used to treat sunburns or a leaf that may be snapped off to reveal a milky white substance used to nourish the skin. And, certainly, Aloe Vera is grown for a variety of agricultural and therapeutic purposes.

There are hundreds of Aloe species that make fantastic aesthetic succulents for pots and gardens, rather than serving that purpose.
Aloe native forms can be found in the wild in Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula, where the climates are usually tropical, semi-tropical, and desert.

A lot of these varieties can be easily available in Etsy, Amazon or some websites particularly dedicated to plants and succulents.

Etsy has been considered as one of the largest sites for buying wild and native varieties of Aloe plants. You may also purchase seeds of the wild variety of the plant you wish to grow. 

*The price point of buying seeds is generally low and you have a high chance of getting your desired variety of succulent.
Some examples of wild Aloe variety are Aloe albida, Grass Aloe, Aloe ‘Venus’, Aloe compressa, Aloe nobilis, Golden Tooth Aloe.*

## 2. AEONIUM

Waxy rosette succulents with thin leaves are popular in coastal beach towns. 

In two respects, they vary from traditional succulents:

1.) Their dormant phase is during the warm months, while their active growing season is during the chilly months.

2.) They store their water reserves in their stems rather than their leaves, therefore their leaves are not fat and meaty.

The variegations in leaf color deepen in full daylight, resulting in a blend of blue and red, deep purple to practically black, and yellow-green.

The genuine blooms bloom in clusters that can be larger than the leaves. They resemble bouquets of ready-to-pick yellow or orange asters. A. arboreum can reach a height of more than a metre when grown in pots, but this can be regulated. The optimal conditions for the plant to thrive are porous soil and full sun.
Because they are native to the Canary Islands, they thrive in coastal communities, with some rando Aeonium distributed throughout Central Africa that provide a similar climate.

**Etsy can be a one stop shop for buying numerous varieties of Aeonium succulents additionally you can also source seeds from websites which sell wild variety seeds. Amazon too is one of a great option to buy this varieties.**

## 3. Agave

Agave is most commonly associated with two things: Agave nectar and Tequila, Tequila, but it has a variety of additional applications.

They're also being used to generate bioenergy, which is fascinating.

Second, they're beautiful ornamental plants, but they can only thrive in desert-like environments. If you put these in a beach town, you'll see how quickly it dies.
 
Only the hottest and driest parts of South and Central America, primarily Mexico and the Caribbean, can support them.

You can get seeds for as cheap as two dollars from different plant seeds websites or you can buy your desired plant from etsy or ebay. Some local gardeners can also source these varieties of succulents if you let them know in advance and provide proper details about the type you want.

## 4. CRASSULA / JADE PLANTS
While Crassula thrive indoors, they prefer to be outside in their natural home in South Africa.

They've been raised, nurtured, and domesticated in Europe and America for more than a century, and have adapted to living indoors as a result.

Pro tip- Pets and people are both somewhat affected by jade plants. What component in these plants causes toxicity is still unknown. If you decide to grow your Jade Plant indoors, keep it out of the reach of your children and dogs. Nausea, vomiting, and lethargy are all signs of intoxication.

It's a little plant that fits into small containers, but in the shade it grows lanky. In the garden, it can also be let to grow into a tree-like form.

Again etsy, ebay and amazon are a great source for purchasing numerous varieties of these succulents.

## 5. ECHEVERIA

Echeverias are popular houseplant succulents, with the ‘Autumn Flame' being one of the most sought hybrids. The rosette of leaves is gleaming and curled, and rather than being green, they are a deep crimson with a lighter tint toward the edges. This medium-sized potted succulent may easily be mistaken for a rose bloom.

Although the plant is normally solitary, fleshy stalks can produce offshoots that can be potted on their own. Echeverias prefer full sun and dry soil, but they can also grow in moderate shade. However, this result in lanky growth and a reduction in leaf color intensity.

They'll be content as long as you can provide a climate similar to that of their own countries, Mexico and Central America.

Etsy and some websites which specialize in selling succulents and blog about it are a resourceful option for buying these plants. Additionally some local farmers and gardeners also harvest these types of succulents.

## 6. KALANCHOE

Look no farther than the Kalanchoe plant if you're seeking for a beautiful succulent to grow. Kalanchoe, like most succulents, is a low-maintenance variety that thrives in bright light and well-draining soil. 

It can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but will not bloom in the winter. Beginning in the spring, you'll be rewarded to bursts of colorful flowers that can last several weeks and recur throughout the year, as long as the plant gets enough light and is pruned properly between blooms by removing the flowering heads and providing only little watering for a few weeks.

More than 100 plant species belong to the genus Kalanchoe, however only a few are commonly found in cultivation. Kalanchoes are popular succulents that are native to Madagascar, Asia, Africa and thrive in arid climates. Kalanchoe is popular among gardeners because of its easy care and interesting leaves and flowers, which blossom year after year in exposure to daylight.

They're a slow-growing variety, needing between two and five years to reach full maturity. Kalanchoe can be found in a variety of colors, including red, pink, yellow, and white, at most grocery shops, nurseries, and florists, especially during the holidays. And of course, you can find a huge variety of deals for kalachoes in etsy.

## 7. SEDUM
Sedums are great for mass plantings, as edging and ground cover, and for growing in pots since they look attractive throughout the growing season, thanks to their intriguing leaves and their flowers. Sedums are also fantastic for bringing butterflies and other pollinators to your yard, as they form long-lasting cut flowers.

These plants require very little upkeep. Simply place them in a location with appropriate soil drainage and sunlight, and they'll almost look after themselves. They don't require deadheading (the removal of spent blooms) and can last well into the winter. 

Extreme heat and a lack of sunshine, on the other hand, might lead sedum plants to become leggy. After the plants have finished flowering, prune them back to keep their shape and encourage bushier, stronger growth.

For buying these plants, the advice goes same as it is for other plants like buying from etsy, local florists or shops or maybe harvesting it yourself by planting seeds.

## 8. SEMPERVIVUM

Sempervivum tectorum (Hens and Chicks) are low-growing evergreen succulent plants that resemble rubbery roses. Because of their hardiness and drought resilience, they are classified as alpine or rock garden plants. The ‘Hen,' the primary rosette, generates small rosette offsets known as the ‘Chicks.'


Sempervivium is a Latin word that means "to live eternally." They don't really live forever, but they appear to do so because they generate so many "chicks" or plantlets. Furthermore, even in frigid locations, they remain evergreen throughout the year. Hens and chicks are drought-resistant plants as well.

They are indigenous to the Mediterranean mountain ranges, as well as central and southern Europe, where the climate is cold and the soil is dry due to the abundance of rocky areas.

These can be easily found in online nurseries, local shops and as usual a huge variety is available in etsy.
