## Is It Possible to Regrow Succulent Leaves?

Has your succulent been shedding leaves? Many succulents lose leaves at one point or the other. It is impossible to regrow succulent leaves that have been cleared. 

**Succulent leaves can only be regrown at the top. Leaves cannot grow back from spots other than the top of the succulent. However, the fallen leaves of many succulents can be propagated to create new plants.**

However, you shouldn’t worry. The first step is to understand why the leaves of your succulents have been falling. Then, remember that precaution and proper care are better than cure.

### Reasons Why Your Succulent Leaves are Falling?

{% include image.html image="many-succulents.jpg" alt="Closeup of many succulent leaves" %}

Many succulents shed leaves at the bottom to make room for new ones at the top. This loss of leaves is natural, but sometimes it may be because of a few other reasons:

**Shock from Overheating**
Is your succulent exposed to more sunlight than needed? Excessive sunlight exposure can cause the plant to get sunburns. As a result, you will notice the leaves changing color, wilting and withering away, eventually falling off. 

A succulent may also overheat if placed too close to the window. The glass of the window can cause the plant to overheat, and refraction can burn the leaves too.

**Shock from Freezing Temperatures**
Low temperatures can cause the leaves to freeze. 

**Watering Issues**
With succulents, both overwatering and underwatering are significant issues. 

**Chemical Stress**
These chemicals can come from excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. They remain on the base of the soil and can cause the plant to lose leaves over time.

## 5 Tips to Help Your Succulent Leaves Regrow Fast

If your succulent leaves have already fallen due to improper temperature, watering, and chemicals, you can use regular caring tips to make the leaves grow faster.

### 1. Provide Proper Light, Temperature, and Water to Your Succulents

{% include quote.html quote="Prevention is better than cure; a healthy succulent is better than a dead one!" %}

{% include image.html image="succulent-watering.jpg" alt="A watering can placed with tiny succulent pots" %}

To make sure your succulent grows leaves faster at the top, you need to avoid all the above reasons that can come in the way. These tips will make sure your succulent is getting the proper care for leaf regrowth:

Keep your plant away from extremely high or low temperatures. It’s better not to keep it in sunlight. 
Water only when the plant needs it, that is, when the base of the soil is dry. Overwatering will not make your plant leaves grow faster; it will only hinder proper growth and can even make your plant die!

### 2. Propagate the Leaves in Fresh Soil

{% include quote.html quote="You can quickly regrow succulents from their leaves!" %}

Propagation is the art and science of growing new plants from offsets or fallen leaves of the parent plant.

Many succulents will not regrow leaves if they have shed from the sides. However, you can make the best use of the fallen leaves. You can grow new plants from the leaves using propagation methods.

Overall, succulents can be propagated using two methods: either the leaves or the stem cuttings. Since we’re concerned with leaves, let’s go through their propagation technique.

**Propagation of Succulents Via Leaves**

{% include image.html image="succulent-leaves.jpg" alt="A small succulent with green leaves and pink edges" %}

Before you begin the propagation process, make sure the leaf is callous and completely dry. If you plant a leaf that is not dry, it will rot and not develop roots.

1. Take a pot (ideally a new one) and fill it with succulent soil mix.
2. Place the leaf on the base of the soil.
3. Put the pot in a spot where there is indirect sunlight.
4. Do not water immediately after planting; only mist it with a spray bottle.

It's best to wait for the leaf to catch roots and become an excellent young plant before beginning to water it regularly. Also, do not expose it to direct sunlight. Filtered or partial sunlight is the best.

### 3. Use the Right Soil and Fertilizer

{% include quote.html quote="Having well-draining soil for your succulent is the first step toward proper growth and regrowth." %}

Depending on the succulent you have, using fertilizers can stimulate growth. However, do keep in mind that not all succulent plants have the ability to regrow leaves even with the use of fertilizer. 

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Never use too much fertilizer!" content="Using a lot of fertilizer can leave chemicals on the base of the soil. These chemicals can alter the growth in the long run, as the plants can overfeed on them. These excessive chemicals will prevent the plants from from regrowing new leaves." %}

If you find excess fertilizer on the base of your soil, you can use water to flush it out. However, remember that you shouldn’t water all at once. Do it only when the base of the soil is dry and the water has completely drained out. It is best practice to limit the use of fertilizer, especially for young or baby succulents that would need only a diluted feed once a month.

Based on my personal experience, you should use {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Gro-Succulent-Plant-Succulents-including/dp/B082BP86KS" text="this all-purpose fertilizer"%} for your succulents.

### 4. Pruning Your Succulent Leaves

{% include quote.html quote="Cutting off leaves will help your succulent grow faster!" %}

It may seem counterproductive to cut off leaves, but it’s not. Pruning dead leaves is very important, as they can suck up the nutrients or lead to pest infestation, which can affect the overall growth of the plant and the leaves. 

It is best to prune your succulent at the beginning or in between the growing season. 

**Steps to Prune Your Succulent**

- Use sharp, sterilized scissors or knives to cut off any extra leaves or offshoots.
- Dead leaves in the pot should be removed immediately, as they cannot be propagated. Use tweezers to pick up these leaves and get rid of them. 
- It would be best if you also pruned any stems on which the leaves look yellow as they can cause more leaves to fall off.

Pruning shifts the growth focus of the plant from flowers and fruits to shoots and leaves. So whether you prune a little or a lot, it will make your succulent grow faster.

### 5. Repot Your Plant 

{% include quote.html quote="Think repotting your plant won’t help grow new leaves? Think again!" %}

{% include image.html image="succulent-in-pot.jpg" alt="A succulent placed in a small pot" %}

**A plant should be repotted if it is growing slowly and losing leaves regularly.**

If your pot is full of many succulents, they will all compete with each other for nutrients. 

So when do you know you should repot your plant? The most direct sign is that you’ll see your succulent plant outgrowing the pot. There is another sign that can ultimately be the opposite. That is, your plant is growing slowly as compared to the average growing capacity and speed of the particular species.

**Steps to Repot Your Plant**

1. Slide one hand gently into the side of the soil in the pot while holding it firmly with the other.
2. Shake the pot a bit and start lifting the soil upward, be careful not to touch the plant, or you may damage the roots.
3. Cut any extra roots that are bounding the soil. Next, take out the plant from the old soil and put it aside on a paper towel.
4. Please choose a new pot and clean it thoroughly before filling it up with fresh soil.
5. Plant your succulent in the new pot.
