## Introduction

For those of you that want to expand their gardens and want to implant rare exquisite breeds, then they might have encountered a familiar experience or fruit known as Vietnam Milk Melon. This bizarre fruit really became the talk of the town due to its shape. Today I will be sharing my thoughts regarding the Vietnam Milk Melon and concluding that either it's fake or not. So, let's start our today's article.

**Yes, it's not a real fruit nor a plant. It's a straightforward seed scam that can still be found on Amazon.**

##  What is a Vietnam Milk Melon?

{% include image.html image="vietnam-milk-lemon.jpg" alt="Vietnam Milk Melon" %}

A Vietnam Milk Melon is basically a fruit known to resemble a female's breast, making it one of the most bizarre scams. Overall the fruit is elongated like a long melon, and the overall fruit color resembles human skin color giving it its name **Vietnam Milk Melon**. 

Apparently, all of its supplies and shipping were known to be made from Vietnam, but there's no genuine information regarding its taste or growth period.

## Are Vietnam Mil Melons Real or Fake? 

**Yes, these are not real fruit nor a plant. It's a straightforward seed scam that can still be found on Amazon.**

All the pictures and hype were both intentionally created, whereas the picture is kind of real and is from a cafe in Hanoi.  The picture was made by an artist, and the milk melons were actually made of silicon, adding a more realistic touch to it.

Many people were scammed of a piece of art, especially those people who have a thing for rare plant seeds. The batch of Vietnam Milk Melon seeds was sold for less than **5$** on multiple enormous sites such as eBay, Amazon, etc. 

Many people did receive seeds, but they were of regular melons. By the time those seeds grew to full shape, the scammer had already sold many and scammed a lot of people.

## Internet and Seed Scams

Vietnam Milk Melon is not the only scam out there. There have been many similar scams where they usually intrigue the customers through exotic products out of nowhere and then scam them for a regular or no product in return. Some of these similar scams are rainbow-colored roses or colored bonsai, etc.

These scammers mostly use photoshopped images or anything like a piece of art similar to what has been used in our current discussed scam. For people who are not aware of such techniques, all this seems genuine, and as a result, they get scammed.

Most of these hoaxes are cheap and newly hyped sensations in the market. Most people go for it due to the low price, which keeps adding up and collectively forms a colossal scam.

## Avoiding Internet Seed Scams

### 1. Stick to Basics

Shopping on the internet can be simplified if you stick to what you know and don't get tempted by yellowish, greenish random alluring rare finds.
