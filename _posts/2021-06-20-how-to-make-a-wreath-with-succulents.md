## Introduction


Do not throw out or give away your older succulents just yet. There's an adorable way to upcycle them. Succulent wreaths are one of the most fun projects you can take on when you're worn out of repotting your plants. You would usually need succulents with a variety of sizes, and most people take this on when they need to make room for a newer collection of succulents.

**All you need are the following: sphagnum moss, floral wire or string, wreath wire frame, nylon mesh tubing, greening pins, succulent cuttings (around 20 to 50 of varying sizes), scissors, a pencil.**

## Step 1. Assemble Your Succulents

{% include image.html image="succulent-assortment.jpg" alt="an assortment of succulents" %}

Before you start on this project, you need to have an assortment of succulents that meet some specific requirements!

- Similar blooming and dormancy periods
- Similar hardiness levels
- Thrive in slightly acidic conditions
- Are all healthy without any infections.

When your assortment of succulents is similar in nature, you'll avoid them fighting for nutrients during different times of the year.

## Step 2. Prune Your Cuttings

{% include image.html image="pruned-cuttings.jpg" alt="cuttings with pruned stems" %}

You'll need about 2" to 3" of stem to snugly fit into your wreath. Take your cuttings and ensure they've been pruned well. Get rid of any dead leaves and have clean stems ready for placement. Allow the pruned ends to callous overnight as this will make it easier to fit into the base of your wreath.

## Step 3. Prepare the Base

It's pretty easy to make a customized base if you have the supplies ready for it. Here's how to go about making the wreath base and ensuring it's secure.

- Identify the outer diameter of the wreath you want. 12" or above is ideal.
- Calculate the perimeter needed.
- Cut out your nylon mesh tubing a few inches above determined perimeter.
- Stuff tubing with loose sphagnum moss and secure the wire mesh.
- Once stuffed, it should be at least 6" of thickness in order to hold your succulents.

And there you have it, but there is still some work left to do.

## Step 4. Assemble the Wreath

{% include image.html image="wreath-base.jpg" alt="a damp wreath base" %}

Soak your wreath on both sides and ensure the water has thoroughly entered the pores of your moss. After that, allow it to drip out the excess water. Then, use a piece of floral wire or string to secure your wreath onto the wire frame. You will want to hold it up to see if it's falling apart anywhere and use additional nylon mesh wherever necessary to hold it steady.

Now you have a wreath frame ready to decorate with your succulent cuttings. If this is something you'd like to save some time and energy on, check out {% include link-amazon.html link="https://www.save-on-crafts.com/products/sphagnum-moss-living-wreath-16-inch " text="this wreath base"%} to buy.

## Step 5. Create Your Incisions

{% include image.html image="incisions.jpg" alt="poking a pen into wreath" %}

Using a pencil, start poking holes into the spots where you will place your succulents. You want to ensure that you're not making holes that are too wide or too close to each other, or your wreath will weaken and unravel. You also risk your succulents falling out from it. Leaving at least 0.5" between each incision, you will start sliding in your succulent cuttings and arranging them as necessary. 

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="" content="Do not create any incisions before the soaking or they may become looser than needed when damp." %}

## Step 6. Place Your Cuttings

{% include image.html image="cuttings-placement.jpg" alt="sliding succulents into place" %}

Start by placing the bigger succulents first and work your way down to the smaller ones as you fill in the gaps. Be sure to use greening pins with each succulent to hold it in place. You don't want to place the smaller ones first as the larger ones will overcrowd their space and prevent sunlight from reaching them.

Again, avoid ramming the greening pins right into your succulents as this will make room for infections. You do not want to pierce the leaves to hold them in place, but to fix the plants down by their stems.

And there you have it! Your very own evergreen wreath that will look good anywhere at any time!

## Conclusion

Now that you have your DIY succulent wreath, feel free to place it in a plate of pebble sand as decoration. You can even go ahead and place a cute candle or other ornament in the center of your wreath, and perhaps even another small plant. There are many ways to use your wreath as decoration, so have fun with it!

The easiest way to create your succulent wreath is to **assemble your succulents, prune them, prepare the base of the wreath, assemble the wreath, create incisions, and place your cuttings**!

Enjoy your new wreath and be sure to place them somewhere you can show them off!
