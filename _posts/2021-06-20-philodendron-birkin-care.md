## Introducing the Philodendron Birkin Plant

The Philodendron Birkin is a beautiful addition to any home, be it indoors or outdoors. The plant can be distinguished by the gorgeous white stripes on its luscious leaves. But that’s not the only reason why it’s my favorite, it’s also one of the easiest plants to maintain!

**The Philodendron Birkin plant thrives well in a humid environment and tropical conditions. It requires moderate, indirect sunlight and the soil must contain sphagnum moss to retain a bit of moisture for relevant humidity. Watering should be done only when the base is dry.**

Given the low-maintenance conditions of this plant, it can be kept as a houseplant with ease. From soil to sun, the Philodendron Birkin is very easy to take care of and grows super fast.

### 1.  How Should You Water the Philodendron Birkin?

**The Philodendron Birkin should be watered immediately when the base of the soil gets completely dry, which usually happens once a week.**

It is essential to know when the soil of your Philodendron Birkin runs dry because this plant loves to be in dampness. This is because it loves high humidity, which is possible and more probable when the soil is wet. 

Moreover, you don’t need to be mindful of the season when watering the Philodendron Birkin. Whether it’s summer, winter, autumn, or spring, you should water this plant once a week for the soil to remain damp and moist.

### 2. What is the humidity requirement of the Philodendron Birkin?

{% include quote.html quote="Since the Philodendron Birkin is a tropical plant, it thrives in high humidity." %}

**The Philodendron Birkin thrives in high humidity due to its tropical origin and needs.**

Moist soil is an absolute favorite of this plant. If the humidity is naturally low where you live, you can mist your Philodendron Birkin a bit. Another way to keep the humidity high is to place this plant along with other plants. Putting plants together as a group helps in sustaining high humidity levels.

### 3. How to Fertilize the Philodendron Birkin?

{% include quote.html quote="The Philodendron Birkin grows super fast for a houseplant!" %}

**The Philodendron Birkin requires monthly fertilization during the growing seasons of Spring and Summer.**

Since it grows so rapidly, it usually needs a lot of nutrients to maintain its thriving levels and health. When using a fertilizer regularly, the Philodendron Birkin will grow exactly at the pace that it does and wouldn’t stay hungry for nutrients. 

You can fertilize this houseplant using various methods, even sticks and balls, but liquid fertilizer is the best and easiest way to go.

### 4. What Soil Should I Use for Philodendron Birkin?

{% include quote.html quote="The soil for your Philodendron Birkin must be able to stay moist for several days!" %}

**Being a tropical plant, the Philodendron Birkin needs a soil mix that can retain moisture well enough for a few days for the plant to grow healthy.**

Tropical plants love to be in moist conditions. To sustain the moist and damp tropical conditions, you cannot use a succulent soil mix that provides too much drainage. It can lead to too much aeration, leaving the plant damaged for proper growth.

So what type of soil should you use for your Philodendron Birkin? Ideally, the soil mix should contain a substance that makes the mix capable of staying damp and moist. 

Take regular potting soil and fill it with two things to assure a balance of drainage and moisture:

- Perlite or pumice (for drainage and aeration): Although the Philodendron Birkin requires moisture, do not skip using perlite. It can prevent root rot and diseases by causing excessive water to drain out.

- Sphagnum moss (for moisture): This moss helps keep the soil mix wet.

Use the above substances for your Philodendron Birkin soil mix to assure there is no problem in soaking in the water and keeping the soil damp.

### 5. What is the Sunlight Requirement of Philodendron Birkin?

{% include quote.html quote="Your Philodendron Birkin plant can thrive in indoor light conditions too!" %}

{% include image.html image="philodendron-leaf.jpg" alt="A philodendron leaf in sunlight" %}

**The Philodendron Birkin needs moderate sunlight, which is neither too low nor direct.**

You can easily place Philodendron Birkin inside. If you live in a house or an apartment where there’s not much light, this plant is perfect to thrive indoors. You can also put the Philodendron Birkin on a windowsill that doesn’t get direct sunlight. If you don’t have windowsills, the plant will thrive well even if you put it in a spot in a room where sunlight is coming in indirectly.

Always make sure that there is sufficient sunlight because:

The plant will literally begin to grow in the direction of the sun if there is a lack of sunlight.
The leaves of the Philodendron Birkin will change their color. The bright white lines may begin to turn to dark green.

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Avoid extremely low-light situations" content="Although the Philodendron Birkin is a tropical plant and can thrive indoors, less light is never the solution. Always keep an eye on the light conditions by checking the direction of plant growth and the color of the leaves." %}

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Direct sunlight is a big no for the Philodendron Birkin!" content="Placing the plant in direct sunlight can cause significant sunburns. If the leaves look withered or scorched, consider moving your plant to a place where there’s no indirect sunlight." %}

## Repotting and Propagating the Philodendron Birkin

### 1. Repotting the Philodendron Birkin

{% include quote.html quote="The Philodendron Birkin grows quite fast!" %}

Repotting is often required for this wonderful houseplant. This doesn’t mean you should repot the Philodendron Birkin after every week or so. But it is highly recommended to change its pot after every one or two years. 

The Philodendron Birkin grows so fast that it can outgrow its pot within one season. For repotting, consider a fresh clean pot that is at least 1 inch or a maximum of 2 inches larger than the pot the plant is currently planted in. 

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Don’t go for a pot too large!" content="
A larger pot may interfere with the soil and humidity level. It can also make excessive water drainage difficult for the plant. The moisture will also be difficult for the plant to absorb and the risks of overwatering will also increase due to the large surface area of the soil." %}

### 2. Propagating the Philodendron Birkin

{% include quote.html quote="Propagating the Philodendron Birkin is as easy as it can get!" %}

**The Philodendron Birkin can be propagated easily using its cuttings.**

Always use a sharp and sterilized knife to make cuttings. The best length for each cutting should be between 3 to 6 inches. After immersing the cutting in water, place the plant in a spot where there is indirect bright light. This light could be artificial, but it’s best if it comes from the sun. Once you see the roots have grown at least an inch long, you can move the cutting in fresh soil in a new pot.

## Common Issues You Should Know About Philodendron Birkin

### Change in Leaf Colors

{% include quote.html quote="Your Philodendron Birkin may be suffering if you find it turning yellow or brown!" %}

**Yellow**

If the leaves of your Philodendron Birkin have been turning yellow, this could either be because it’s getting older or because of too much water. One indication of old age is that even the leaves in the lower part of the stem will turn yellow. However, in another case, it may be overwatering. Always keep the base of the soil dry and never water your plant in case there is already water standing at the top of the soil. Make sure your soil mix is well-draining and that there are enough holes to drain excessive moisture. Remember that although the Philodendron Birkin is a tropical plant and likes humidity, drainage is still a necessity to avoid excessively high levels of humidity.

**Brown**
When the Philodendron Birkin doesn’t get enough humidity, its leaves become crispy and the color also changes to brown. This is a sign of a dry environment and you immediately need to put your plant in a spot where it’s warm and moist.

## Summing Up Plant Care for the Philodendron Birkin

The Philodendron Birkin should be planted in well-draining soil mix as it does not like being watered too much or a moist environment. It is an easy to maintain houseplant, as it needs neither direct light nor too much shade, moderate light is ideal.
