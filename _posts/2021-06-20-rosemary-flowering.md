## Introduction

You can recognize the beautiful blue blooms of Rosemary flowering from anywhere. These plants are perennial, which means you can grow them year-round. And their pink, purple, blue, or white flowers look absolutely stunning!

**The Rosemary flowering thrives both outdoors and indoors. It needs well-draining soil, full sunlight (bright sunlight if indoors), a temperature above 30 degrees Fahrenheit, moderate humidity, and evenly-spread infrequent watering to survive and grow well.**

If you take care of this plant properly, it can grow as tall as 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide. And if that’s not enough, there are so many varieties of the Rosemary flowering for you to grow and enjoy. Here are a few varieties according to the purpose you want to grow this beautiful plant!

**For Cooking**

- Spice Island
- Miss Jessup
- Tuscan Blue

The rosemary varieties for cooking can grow even taller, up to 6 feet! You can use their leaves for cooking, as they provide both fragrance and a scrumptious flavor. To use them, you can either fry them or dry them!

**For Planting and Beautifying**

- Golden Rain
- Blue Boy

The Blue Boy species is perfect for rosemary plant lovers who like small plants. Although the Golden Rain variety is small too, its leaves are different in the way that they form a weeping shape and even have markings on them, that can turn from yellow to green.

Starting off with a small rosemary plant is the best way to go! It’s small, it’s inexpensive and you’ll get to learn a lot about rosemary growth while taking care of it!

## How Can a Rosemary Be Grown?

{% include quote.html quote="You can grow a rosemary flowering in both pots and the ground!" %}

{% include image.html image="rosemary-flowers.jpg" alt="Many rosemary flowers outdoors" %}

**A rosemary flowering plant can be grown both indoors and outdoors. However, the level of maintenance and care required would be different for both.**

Here are some helpful tips to plant a Rosemary:

The area should be spacious, as these plants can grow four feet tall and spread to four feet in width.

If you have more herbs in your garden, it's best to plant your rosemary along with them. Planting herbs together can lead to companion planting, which is really good for our green friends.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Utilize Rosemary Cuttings!" content="Is your Rosemary plant looking down in the winter? Don't worry, you can make use of its cuttings! Get a sharp knife and separate cuttings to plant in the growing season." %}

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Shift the plant carefully!" content="Are you thinking of shifting your grounded rosemary plants into containers? Grounded plants may not thrive well if you shift them into planters. If you do so, make sure you bring in the plant inside when it's freezing or the temperature drops too low." %}

### 1. What is the Ideal Soil for the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="Your Rosemary flowering will thrive in well-draining soil!" %}

{% include image.html image="pink-rosemary.jpg" alt="Pink colored rosemary flowers" %}

**The ideal soil temperature for the rosemary flowering is 21 degrees celsius.**

Hailing from Mediterranean coasts, it makes sense that the Rosemary flowering needs well-draining soil. The plant is also not fond of intense dampness and moisture, hence a soiling mix with perlite and pumice can aid in preventing the humidity levels from getting too high.

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="Never let the soil get too damp!" content="The soil mix should have proper aeration, otherwise, the roots of your rosemary flowering may begin to rot." %}

### 2. What is the Sunlight Requirement of the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="Your rosemary plant will be the happiest in full sunlight!" %}

{% include image.html image="rosemary-in-bloom.jpg" alt="Purple rosemary flowers outdoors" %}

**The Rosemary flowering thrives in full exposure to the sun, approximately six to eight hours of direct sunlight is the optimum need.**

If your rosemary is inside, keep it in a brightly lit place. Avoid keeping it too near the window as the plant can easily overheat and get burnt from the glass.

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Protect your rosemary plant from low temperatures!" content="Be protective of your rosemary when the temperatures drop! Below 30 degrees Fahrenheit can make the plant frost." %}

### 3. What is the Humidity Requirement of the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="Your rosemary plant can grow so tall in moderate humidity!" %}

{% include image.html image="two-rosemary-flowers.jpg" alt="Two rosemary flowers" %}

**The Rosemary requires moderate humidity to attain maximum height. Fluctuating levels of humidity are well handled by the Rosemary.**

Since Rosemary flowering can maintain all levels of humidity, you can place them both indoors or outdoors. However, if the temperature falls below 30 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s best to bring your plant indoors. 

### 4. How Should I Water the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="Your rosemary plant can be quite sensitive to water!" %}

{% include image.html image="white-rosemary.jpg" alt="A white rosemary flowering plant" %}

**The Rosemary requires evenly spread, infrequent watering sessions throughout the growing season of Spring and Summer. During winter, the watering should be decreased by half.**

Rosemary is not keen on getting excessive water. It does not need to be watered every day. So if you want your rosemary to grow well, look out for signs of underwatering or overwatering. Always watch the soil for any signs of standing water. Moreover, if the leaves look droopy or withered, that can be a clear sign of underwatering. 

### 5. How to fertilize the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="This Meditteranean plant loves a ‘fishy’ fertilizer!" %}

**The Rosemary flowering plant can be fertilized using a fish-based fertilizer during the growing season of Spring.**

Using a fertilizer for your rosemary plant is completely optional. However, fertilizing the plant during the growing season may encourage faster growth. Alternatively, you can also spray it with diluted fertilizer. Diluted fertilizers are a great choice for young plants as there is less concentration.

### 6. How to prune the Rosemary flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="You can prune the top of the Rosemary flowering to encourage branch growth!" %}

**Trimming the Rosemary flowering from the top will make room for more branches and hence, more flowering.**

It’s not necessary to make your Rosemary flowering smaller by pruning it. If you trim it from the top, the width would remain the same and the size won’t look changed at all. You can expect more branches to come out from the top. Hence, pruning is one of the most perfect ways to increase both the height and width of your rosemary plant.

### 7. How to Repot the Rosemary Flowering?

{% include quote.html quote="Your rosemary flowering can grow faster if you repot it once every year!" %}

**The Rosemary flowering plant should be repotted annually, at least once. The most ideal time to repot this plant is during the Spring season, but other seasons work equally well.**

To avoid repotting in the winter, it’s best to keep your rosemary containers indoors. You should repot your Rosemary flowering plant once the soil has stopped giving the plant proper nutrients. You should also repot it if it has started growing larger than its pot.

## Things You Should Know About the Rosemary Flowering

### 1. Propagating the Rosemary

{% include quote.html quote="The Rosemary flowering can be easily propagated using cuttings." %}

**The Rosemary plant can be propagated using fresh cuttings or seeds. Dip the cuttings into fresh yet damp soil, misting them and leaving them in a warm place with indirect sunlight. Propagation is also possible using seeds.**

**Steps to Propagate the Rosemary flowering**

- Take cuttings of at least 2 inches from a well-grown rosemary plant.
- Make sure there are no leaves in at least a one-inch range of the lower part of the stem. If there are, just cut them carefully using a sterilized knife, without hurting the stem of the cutting.
- Dip the cutting into a slightly moist, yet well-draining soil.
- Place the pot in a spot where there is indirect sunlight. 
- You can water your freshly planted cuttings but not using a can or a vessel. Use the misting technique instead to make sure the soil stays damp and the cuttings are rejuvenated now and again.
- After the cuttings have developed roots, you can plant each in a pot or container of their own. A size of 4 inches is ideal for these baby rosemary plants. Do not go for a plant that’s too big, otherwise, it can cause underwatering issues, and if you choose a pot that’s too small, you may end up overwatering the plant instead.

Although it is also possible to grow the Rosemary using its seeds, that process is comparatively more difficult than using cuttings.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Check for your rosemary flowering roots!" content="You can test for root development after 2 to 3 weeks of planting the cuttings. Using your finger, tug them gently and you’ll feel whether they are loose or firm. If they seem firm, they have developed roots!" %}

{% include warning.html title="WARNING!" subtitle="Avoid direct sunlight!" content="Never put newly planted cuttings in direct sunlight. Give some time for the baby plants to settle in the new soil and the surrounding environment." %}

### 2. Common Issues With the Rosemary Plant

{% include quote.html quote="Most issues with the rosemary flowering plant are due to improper humidity levels!" %}

Both high and low humidity levels can cause diseases and other infections with the Rosemary plant. Following are some common issues you may encounter:

**Powdery Mildew**
If you see a white substance on the leaves of your rosemary, it’s most probably powdery mildew. This can happen when the plant is getting more humidity and less air than required. Although this doesn’t make the plant die or wear off immediately, it weakens and breaks down the plant with time.

**Damaged and Dying Leaves**
Low humidity will cause the leaves to die and eventually kill the plant.

**Spider mites and aphids**
These pests are most likely to attack your Rosemary during the winter when the plant is placed indoors. Instead of using an insecticide, it is best to remove the insects manually when they are in a low quantity. Use insecticidal soaps or other disinfectants only when the infestation is has gotten out of hand.

**Diseases:**
You may find your rosemary flowering infected with bacterial leaf spots. Be mindful of any standing water on the base of the soil or pouring water directly on the leaves.

**Root Rot:**
There can be different types of root rotting. Mostly due to overwatering or underwatering.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="Give proper air circulation!" content="Don’t have enough air circulation where your plants are? Try turning on the fan to provide proper ventilation to your succulent." %}

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-Tip" subtitle="You can balance humidity levels!" content="The best way to maintain proper humidity is to balance the amount of water you give to your rosemary plant. Always allow the soil to dry before watering your plant again. If the soil is taking time to dry, avoid misting or watering the plant at all costs!" %}

## Summing Up the Rosemary Flowering Care

The Rosemary flowering plant can be placed both indoors and outdoors. It produces pink, white, blue, or purple flowers during the growing season of Spring.
