## Rocks for Your Succulent Garden

A succulent garden is a beautiful arrangement of various succulent plants. I love placing stones along with succulents because the burst of nature looks absolutely gorgeous.

**Rocks placed in a succulent garden add to the aesthetic appeal of the overall space. They can also act as protective covers for succulent plants.**

So what type of rocks can look good in your succulent garden? When choosing these rocks, you will have to consider the crush, color, and groundcover effects that they provide to succulent plants.

Here are the four different types of natural stone categories you can use for top dressings:

**Boulders:**
These are the largest pieces of rock. Ideally, these are best for people who have gigantic succulent gardens.

**Crushed Rock:**
Crushed rocks consist of angular stone pieces. These can be in assorted sizes or just in one size.

**Rubble:**
When you crush rock into large pieces, you get rubble. Although rubbles are crushed, they aren’t as small as crushed grains. They are significantly larger than cobbles and pebbles.

**Cobbles and Pebbles:**
Consider these as extremely tiny boulders. Pebbles come in a variety of sizes, but most of them are medium and go best with plants of moderate size too, that are neither too big nor small.

## Why is Adding Rocks to Your Succulents a Good Idea?

{% include quote.html quote="Rocks can be placed both in an outdoor and indoor succulent garden!" %}

It is possible to use rocks for both succulents planted outdoors and indoors. Whether your succulents are planted outdoors in the ground, or they are in pots and planters, you can easily add rocks. To add contrast to your succulents, I would suggest that you use rocks that are different either lighter or darker in color compared to the plants.

Apart from aesthetics, these rocks also prevent the soil of your plant from getting distorted while watering. They help keep the base of the soil in place.

## Rocks You Should Avoid Using for Your Succulent Garden

{% include quote.html quote="Not all rocks can be beneficial for your succulents!" %}

Some rocks may look good, but they cannot be used as they can cause damage to succulent plants. Avoid using non porous rocks that can hinder your plants growth. You can check the porous characteristics of a rock by soaking it in water before you decide to use it as a top-dressing for your succulents.

{% include warning.html title="" subtitle="Be cautious of non-porous rocks!" content="Rocks that alter the drainage system of succulents can harm your plant. " %}

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Be mindful of the rock color!" content="Don’t choose stones of dark colors if you live in a hot climate. The heat from the stones can transfer to the succulent plants and burn them." %}


## Which Rock Would You Choose?

So remember that choosing rocks for your succulent garden is not just about the aesthetics but you should also consider the environment. Avoid using dark colors if it’s too hot where you live. Similarly, never use non-porous rocks as they can interfere with proper drainage of the succulents. Moreover, you can choose all these rocks in multiple forms. From boulders to rubbles to tiny pebbles, there are stones of different sizes depending upon the size of your succulent garden.
