## Introduction

Aloe vera is *not* a cactus. Confused? As humans, we rely on visual cues for identifying things. Despite that, things that fall under similar categories externally could have very different internal systems which sets them apart. Still, they are definitely succulents, so there is some sort of open-ended connection between these plants.

Here is what makes them different from each other: **Their family, leaves, overall size, edibility, stored nutrients, medical uses, and blooming frequency**.

## Difference 1: Family

{% include image.html image="difference-one.jpg" alt="three lilies" %}

Perhaps one of the biggest differences between cacti and aloe vera is quite literally their genes. Aloe Vera is a member of the lily family, and is genetically closer to lotus flowers than cacti. As strange as it is, there is a reason it's called the Lily of Africa.

## Difference 2: Leaves

It's understandable where the confusion comes from when the aloe vera has sharp prickles along the edges. But the fact of the matter is that while aloe vera has those ridges on its *leaves*, the spikes on the cactus *are the leaves*.

See, the fleshy part of the cactus is the stem, whereas you can't exactly see the stem on an aloe vera plant. It's obvious why an aloe vera plant is more of a succulent than a cactus.

## Difference 3: Overall Size

{% include image.html image="difference-three.jpg" alt="succulents of different sizes" %}

Cacti can grow pretty large outside of a home, but the aloe vera stays relatively close to the ground. Because of its differing functions and difference in base structure, aloe vera plants don't have the stems to grow too high up from the soil.

Their leaves may elongate and reach out pretty far under the right conditions, which sets it apart from other, jucier looking succulents. Despite the long leaves, it still has a lot of mass as opposed to thinner leaves.

## Difference 4: Edibility

While both aloe and cactus are edible, there is still a clear divide in the main purpose of consuming them.

While a cactus can nourish you, the aloe vera plant will provide healing. Both are great for consumption *in moderation*. Make sure you know how to cook them well because both of these plants can be quite bitter in taste. The texture also needs getting accustomed to.

{% include warning.html title="Warning!" subtitle="" content="Plants are generally great to consume, but take care with cacti and succulents as they do not operate like most plants do. You may be prone to specific allergies within them." %}

## Difference 5: Stored Nutrients

The benefits that come from eating either aloe vera or cacti can be used to its full potential when you know which gives what.

Aloe vera, with its healing properties, contains all kinds of anti-oxidants and vitamins. This means it helps with issues like acid reflux, digestion, and detox. It's great for your gut in general.

Cacti are great for building up a healthier body as they contain a lot of minerals like magnesium, potassium, and many more. But be careful, not all cacti can be consumed!

## Difference 6: Medical Uses

While aloe vera is great for the inside of your body, it's also great for the outside. Aloe is used for a lot of skin conditions like burns, acne, bacterial infections, and even inhibits dental plaque!

Cacti are not to be taken as casually as aloe vera, though. Only those well-read in these matters will tell you which cactus species will provide you benefits. The wrong one could cause a funny or otherwise dangerous episode of intoxication.

{% include pro-tip.html title="Pro-tip" subtitle="" content="Aloe vera has a lot of great uses not just for your skin and gut, but also for your hair. Once you learn how to use aloe vera to your advantage, you might cut down on buying ointments from your local pharmacy." %}

## Difference 7: Blooming Frequency

{% include image.html image="difference-seven.jpg" alt="cactus with flowers" %}

A lot of cacti species are monocarpic, and this means that they die after flowering. They also flower extremely infrequently, which means you'll see a flower on a cactus perhaps in its 30s.

Opposed to that, aloe vera gives flowers quite often and do not die after. You might see multiple blooms in its lifetime, and perhaps even in a year if they're taken care of very well!

## Conclusion

Now that we know what makes aloe vera so different from cacti, we can make good use of each of them accordingly. The seven main differences are **their family, leaves, overall size, edibility, stored nutrients, medical uses, and blooming frequency**.

Perhaps you could use this as a fun little trivia with all your succulent loving friends!
