## Pink Flowering Trees

Flowering trees add to the landscape unlike any other. Pink is my favorite color, and I’m sure you’ll think the same once you go through this beautiful list of pink flowering trees!

**Pink flowering trees can be found in any part of the world. These trees mostly bloom during the Spring season and require a sufficient amount of sunlight to produce flowers. Some common ones are cherry trees, redmunds, and magnolias.**

Pink is one of the most refreshing colors. Tone down any shade of red, and it gives you pink. A visually soft and playful color, which gives the touch of wonderland when planted in trees. There are many ways to use these pink trees in your landscape. Whether you have a small outdoor garden space or a big one, there’s a pink tree out there to suit every height and width!

### 1. Saucer Magnolia Tree

{% include image.html image="saucer-magnolia-tree-full.jpg" alt="A full view of a pink saucer magnolia tree" %}

**Botanical name:** Magnolia grandiflora
**Type:** Deciduous
**Height:** 20 to 30 feet
**Width:** 15 to 20 feet
**Sunlight:** Partial shade, full sunlight
**Soil type:** Fertile, well-draining soil mix can also grow in sandy or loamy soil
**Produces fruit:** Yes
**Growth rate:** Moderate
**Moisture:** Moderate (become more drought-tolerant with age)
**Pollinator-friendly:** Yes
**Growing season:** Early Spring
**Hardiness:** USDA zones 5 to 9

The teacup-shaped blooms of the Saucer Magnolia tree will make you wish you had a tea party underneath it every evening. The flowers will begin to appear first thing in the Spring. When small, they are around 5 inches but they can fully bloom to a width of 10 inches, making them look like giant saucers!

You can also pick saucer magnolia trees that have white and purple flower varieties. Almost every flower has an inner white touch, which makes the saucer magnolia bichromatic and a glamorous choice. As for the leaves, they are soft and have a saturated green tone (during the summer) but do expect them to change into a fusion of yellow and brown in the fall! If you look carefully, the bottom side of the leaves will appear fuzzy. The tree grows a lot of stems, but you can prune it if you don’t like the symmetrical look created by its multiple stems.

The Saucer magnolia best blooms in warmer climates. The growing season usually lasts from February to April but you can also expect the flowers to grace your garden in summer and winter (if it’s not that harsh) too. The fragrance will last in all seasons.

With the Saucer magnolia tree planted in your garden, you can also expect to see a lot of hummingbirds as they love the nectar of these flowers. Moreover, the tree produces many seeds in the fall that can attract even more birds to your garden.

Since this tree has so many stems, it can provide you excellent coverage if you want some privacy from your neighbors! Just make sure to plant your saucer magnolia tree where it gets six hours of direct sunlight! It’s important if you want many healthy flowers to bloom, that too with lush and soft pink tones. Also, keep the soil moist!

Except during the winter, as in USDA 5 to 9 zones, you can expect these trees to protect themselves from the harsh cold in the winter and even the scorching heat of the summer.

**Height:** 15 to 25 feet
**Width:** 15 to 20 feet

**Produces fruit:** Yes (red berries)
**Growth rate:** Fast
**Moisture:** Moist, but can adjust to dry soil conditions too
**Pollinator-friendly:** Yes
**Growing season:** Spring
**Hardiness:** USDA zones 5 to 9

Although the Dogwood tree mostly produces white blooms, you can find pink ones as well. The flowers mostly have four petals that are bent inward like dog ears! Even the pink flowers may have a touch of white to them, in the form of lines going inwards. 

In the summer, you’ll find the Pink Dogwood leaves green but in the winter, they change to a deep crimson shade. If it snows where you live, you’ll also notice the bark becoming a fusion of cinnamon and grey during winter. 

The Pink Dogwood tree is a common choice in the United States as it’s a native. The actual flowers of this tree are very small, which you can find within four bracts. 

What makes the flowers of the Pink Dogwood tree different is that you’ll get to experience many pink shades. Most of the trees start with light pink flowers which turn into a deep rose pink as they grow. 

If you plant multiple pink dogwood trees at the same time, all the trees will be of various ages and produce flowers of an array of pink colors - making your garden look like a pink wonderland!

The pink dogwood tree can be planted anywhere in your garden, from the patio to the entrance. The flowers won’t take too long to bloom. The Pink Dogwood tree starts blooming even when it is around 3 to 4 feet tall. In fact, at times, you’ll notice that the flowers even bloom before this gorgeous pink tree produces more leaves. 

To make the arrangement more interesting, try planting them spontaneously or in curved patterns rather than in a regular line. If you’re fond of more colors and contrast, plant white and red dogwood trees too. 

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Use garden lighting" content="You can use extra lighting or garden accessories and place them around the Pink Dogwood tree to further bring out its beauty." %}

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Add birdhouses!" content="Since the Pink Dogwood tree produces red berries, it’s an invitation to birds. It will add to the blossoming beauty of your pink dogwood tree! Add tiny birdhouses in the surrounding area or on the tree if you can." %}

{% include pro-tip.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Use mulch!" content="Are you having trouble with keeping the soil organic for your pink dogwood tree? Take some mulch and layer it evenly on the base of the ground, right above the tree roots. It will both protect the sources and help keep the soil moist and cool. You can also water your plant weekly, as required." %}

### 3. Japanese Crabapple trees

If your garden is small, Japanese crabapple trees are your best pick. They don’t grow too large and mostly either remain small or medium. 

The Japanese Crabapple trees will add a burst of red, pink, and white to your garden. When its flowers are buds, they are pure red. As they grow and continue to blossom, you’ll see the color-shifting toward dark pink and slowly transforming into a baby pink, with a blast of white! Along with the flowers, you will also see tiny red fruits appearing near the blooms. These fruits are very small but you can make jelly out of them if they don’t already get eaten by birds!

To add to the thrill, the way they grow is unique! You can find them developing foliage in various ways, from upright to weeping arrangements. The most beautiful part is that during the fall, the leaves may either turn red or yellow. So although the tree does not bear fruit during the cold seasons, the leaves make up for the missing splash of red color.

### 4. Eastern Redbud

If Spring is your favorite season (and I bet it is!), you can’t go wrong with planting the Eastern Redbud as it boasts prideful pink flowers for several weeks.

The Eastern Redbud also has excellent resistance against all kinds of diseases to add to the splendid pink show. You can also use it in any landscape at all since it can tolerate water quite well. You need not be extra cautious or alarmed if you have it planted beside trees or plants that require a lot of water.

The Eastern Redbud also produces lovely heart-shaped leaves that can provide shade under the harsh, scorching summer sun to add to the pink glory. You’ll find the leaves turning yellow in the fall season, and that’s alright!

Pair the pom poms of this redbud tree with the eastern variety, and your yard will bloom with tones, tints, and shades of warm hues of pinks and subtle purples! This tree is an eye-turner, and it’s an easy one to maintain too. It’s one of the versatile pink flowering trees as it can thrive both in partial sunlight with a minimum of 4 hours, or it could even take in full exposure to the sun.

The beautiful pink flowers of the Orchid Satin Rose of Sharon tree look like they have red eyes painted in the inside of the petals. These red lines extend from the middle of the flower towards the outer edges, but not all the way to the tips. These flowers don’t really produce seeds but they have a lot of nectar in store for both butterflies and birds.

Although this tree is the size of a shrub, the red within the pink flowers looks illusionary from a distance. If you want to create more interest, try planting the purple versions of these trees along with the pink ones.
