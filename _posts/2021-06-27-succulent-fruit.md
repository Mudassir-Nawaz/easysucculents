## What is a Succulent Fruit?

Succulents are a delight for anyone who is looking for low-maintenance plants. But did you know that many of them grow fruits that you can eat without hesitating?

**A succulent fruit is a category of fruits, such as peaches, etc. Alternatively, it may also refer to fruit that grows on succulent plants, such as cacti. Succulent fruits on cacti are dragon fruit, prickly pears, and bahidaj.**

Many succulent parts can be toxic for humans and animals. However, numerous succulents produce safe fruits not just for animals but also for you!

For succulents that produce fruit, most of them grow on cacti. However, fruits categorized as ‘succulents’ are due to their fleshy texture and grow on regular plants, not succulent plants.

## Fruits that are ‘Succulents’
