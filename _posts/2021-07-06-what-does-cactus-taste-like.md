## Introduction

Are you a cactus lover? Well, so am I! And while most cacti have spines, you can eat them too! Really, it's no joke, I still remember the first time I ate a cactus and instantly fell in love with it. Although you can't eat all cacti species and you'll also have to take care of how you choose to eat them.&nbsp;

**A cactus has a very sour taste. The sticky and crunchy pads taste like green vegetables, particularly like asparagus. Some cactus pads may also taste like green beans or green peppers.&nbsp;**

## Can you eat all cacti species?

**The Nopales or the Opuntia cacti species are the safest to eat. Their parts are all edible and do not have any poisonous characteristics.** 

### Nopales Cactus

The Nopales is just another name for the Opuntia species. There are more than 200 species of the Opuntia cactus, and you can eat all of them as long as you follow all the precautions and processes. The most common edible nopales cactus is the prickly pear cactus.

This is the cactus that also produces fruits which are known as pears. You can eat many parts of the prickly pear cactus - its paddle, flower, and fruit.

**Cactus pads become slimy when they are cooked improperly.&nbsp;** 

If you choose to eat cactus pads uncooked, it would feel sticky in your mouth. You'll feel the crunchy taste as it enters your mouth. While it may not be dangerous, it can be unhygienic. So it's always best to clean and thoroughly cook your cactus before eating it.

**It is preferable to boil a cactus before eating.&nbsp;** 

Whichever way you choose to eat your cactus, it's best to not select a withered or wrinkled piece. Such a cactus pad may not have the punch of flavor you're expecting or may even be more sour than usual.

### Boiling

You can cook cacti easily by boiling. However, regardless of the cactus species, you cannot cook all its parts.&nbsp;

If you want to boil cactus leaves, here are some tips you should follow:

1. Take off all the spines using a clean knife.
2. Chop it into extremely tiny pieces, just like you would do with any other vegetable.
3. Boil at low heat for around 20 minutes.

After you're done with boiling, you can drain off excess water. Take some cold water and rinse the cactus pieces thoroughly.&nbsp;
