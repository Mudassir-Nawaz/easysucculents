## Introduction

Succulents are plants that are known for their exceptional water-retaining properties. These plants have thick fleshy parts but can we call them leaves?

**Most succulents have thick fleshy leaves that help them retain water. These leaves are often very few in number and small.&nbsp;**

## Do Succulents Have Leaves?

**Yes, most succulents have a few small leaves that are thick and fleshy. They help store water in dry conditions.&nbsp;** <br>

## 1. They come in different colors

Most succulents come in different shades of green. However, it is interesting to know that red, yellow, blue, and purple succulents exist too.&nbsp;

Some succulents develop red tips in response to prolonged hours of direct sunlight. If succulents did not change color this way in response to exposure to direct sunlight, they would get sunburnt.&nbsp;

Similarly, other plants turn yellow when exposed to extremely dry conditions. This is another coping mechanism succulents undergo.&nbsp;

## 2. Propagation through leaf cuttings

Did you know that you could grow another succulent by planting just a leaf? All you need is gently cut off a few leaves of your succulent and set them aside to dry first.&nbsp;

You will need a set of tools such as shears, a trowel, gloves and a pot container. You can use a pair of small scissors for your cactus depending on the size. You will have to wait for at least 5 days for some root growth until you can get around to planting your leaves.&nbsp;

You will need to pour your choice of potting medium into a pot container. After you have planted the leaf cuttings into well-drained soil, leave the pot in direct sunlight for a few hours.&nbsp;

## 3. Most Succulents aren't Cacti

Succulents are often confused with cacti. However, there is a clear distinction between succulents and cacti. Cacti often have thorns and not leaves. Succulents have thick fleshy leaves and don't have thorns.&nbsp;

You might have heard a lot of people mistake succulents for cacti. That is only because cacti can fall under the category of succulents. Cacti often have thick woody stems that are hard to touch. The same isn't true for succulents.&nbsp;

Most succulents have very soft and feathery leaves. You might be tempted to hold a succulent frequently. However, it is best not to do the same with a cactus. The shape and size of bristles on a cactus vary with the species.

## 4. Succulents can hide in nature

stones, actually blend in their natural environment very well. They closely resemble actual stones and rocks.&nbsp;

This helps them stay hidden from the line of sight of potential predators in the wild. Similarly, other succulents make themselves look unappealing to predators.&nbsp;

## 5. Succulents can survive extreme winter conditions
