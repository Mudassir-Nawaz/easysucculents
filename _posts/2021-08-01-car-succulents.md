## How to Keep your Car Succulents Alive

**Car succulents can be kept alive if you monitor the car's temperature, water them outside, place them where they get plenty of sunlight, clean them, check for pests and keep them in a secure spot.&nbsp;** 

## 1. Monitor the Temperature

The first thing you can do to make sure your succulent is comfortable in its new environment is to keep a close check on the temperature of its immediate surroundings. You can do this by using a thermometer.&nbsp;

Most succulents can survive extreme heat. However, it is advised not to leave them exposed to extreme heat for prolonged hours. Overheating can cause plant death in most cases.

## 2. Water them Outside

Watering your succulents inside the car will do you no good. It is best that you remove them from your car and place them outside to water them. Be careful with overwatering your car succulents since succulents do not require much water.

## 3. Place them in a Sunny Spot

One of the most important things you can do to make sure your succulent stays alive and healthy is to ensure it gets plenty of sunlight. Most succulents enjoy a few hours of direct sunlight.&nbsp;

You might want to look for a nice spot inside your car for your succulents. However, you will need to shift their position since prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause burns to your succulent.

## 4. Clean them

You have to make sure your succulents do not collect dust or smoke inside your car. You will have to check your succulents frequently for any dust buildup. This type of buildup can cause infections.

You can use a dusting cloth or brush to clean your succulents thoroughly. You will have to be gentle with your plant while brushing off the dust. Succulent leaves tend to be soft and can be damaged very easily.

## 5. Check for Pests

When taking care of any succulent, it is important to keep an eye out for any pests. A pest infestation can ruin both your succulent's aesthetic and health. Make sure you keep your succulents in a clean spot in your car.&nbsp;

Insects like aphids are quick to attack succulent leaves. No need to worry since you can spray soapy water on your succulents if you notice any pest infestation.&nbsp;

## 6. Place them in a Secure Spot
