## Introduction

Aloe vera leaves hold the secret to flawless skin. However, if you're new to adding aloe vera to your skincare routine, you must be wondering about how long you should keep it on your face.

**Aloe Vera has to be in your face for only 10 minutes. If you forget to rinse your face after that, your skin might become dry.** &nbsp;

## How Long to Leave Aloe vera for Good Results

**If you have just added aloe vera to your skincare, only keep it on your face for 10 minutes. If you keep it longer than that, your skin can become very dry.&nbsp;** 

## How to Apply Aloe vera on Face

Before applying aloe vera on your face, you need to make sure your face is clean. You will need to wash your face and remove makeup if you had it on. Then use your fingertips to apply it gently on your face.&nbsp;

You will need to leave it on for 10 minutes maximum to get the best results. Then rinse it off with cool water. You can even use aloe vera as a cleanser and apply it twice a day.&nbsp;

However, while using aloe vera as a skincare product, you will need to keep a check on how frequently you apply it. Excessive use of aloe vera can lead to dry itchy skin. If your skin becomes dry, it produces more oil. This can result in your pores becoming clogged again and cause acne.&nbsp;

## Tips

If you're someone who enjoys leaving a face mask on overnight, you will need to pair your mask with another moisturizing product. Since aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties, it can also be used to prevent acne. Aloe vera makes a natural exfoliating liquid and ensures your skin clears out and becomes soft.&nbsp;

You can even use aloe vera on the acne you already have. Doing so can reduce redness and swelling. If you are someone who suffers from a skin condition such as eczema, it is best to consult your dermatologist first.&nbsp;

## Combinations

Aloe vera can be used with a bunch of other skincare ingredients such as tea tree oil, cinnamon, honey and lemon juice to enhance its benefits. Keep reading to find out more!

## Aloe vera and Tea Tree Oil

Did you know that you could combine aloe vera with tea tree oil to enhance its benefits? Doing so reduces the risk of acne breakouts and reduces inflammation. Since tea tree oil is also a valuable skincare product, using it in a combination with aloe vera can produce great results.&nbsp;

Preparing a mask out of a mixture of aloe vera and tea tree oil can help clear pores and clean them. If you suffer from oily skin, adding tea tree oil to aloe vera gel will help make your skin become refreshed.&nbsp;

You will have to rinse the mask off thoroughly in the morning. You can always store the remaining mixture in an air-tight bottle. You could use it to even out the tone of your skin as well.&nbsp;

## Aloe vera and Cinnamon

Cinnamon is another ingredient that is popular for its skincare benefits. Adding cinnamon powder to a mixture of aloe vera gel and water can help get rid of acne quickly. You will need to leave the mask on for an hour before rinsing it off.&nbsp;

Cinnamon even has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. You should definitely add this ingredient to your skincare routine if you want to remove acne marks.&nbsp;

## Aloe vera and Honey

Did you know that honey was naturally anti-fungal? Honey has great skincare benefits since it is very hydrating. Adding honey to a mixture of aloe vera gel can help you get rid of acne and acne spots.&nbsp;

You will need to blend 1 tbsp of honey with aloe vera gel extracted from one leaf. Use a brush to apply a thin layer of the blended mixture on your face. Wait for 15 minutes before rinsing it off.&nbsp;

## Aloe vera and Lemon juice

You might have heard about how bad applying lemon juice alone on your face is. However, diluting it with aloe vera gel prevents it from causing inflammation.&nbsp;

You'll have to be careful with the ratio of aloe vera to lemon juice you add to your mask. Make it 8 : 1. Lemon juice is rich in Vitamin C which helps brighten acne scars. On the other hand, aloe vera gel is known to help with collagen production which makes the skin look fresh.&nbsp;
