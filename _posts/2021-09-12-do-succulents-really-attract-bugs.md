Now that you know succulents can fall prey to bugs, you might be wondering about how to spot a pest infestation. Well, we've got you covered!

## 1. Mealybugs

Mealybugs are tiny white bugs that resemble small crabs. They feed off plant juices. Only the adult male mealybugs can fly. You might be interested to know that these pests attack succulents in warmer climates.&nbsp;

These pests are often difficult to find since they can hide in holes and crevices. These pests can be found both indoors and outdoors. They are attracted to plants with high levels of nitrogen.

Mealybugs can sneak into your indoor succulent through the new potting soil mix you got from the market. These bugs often look like tiny cotton balls. They do not cause harm to humans but the residue they produce can cause itchy skin.&nbsp;

## How to Get Rid of Mealybugs

You will need rubbing alcohol or neem oil to get rid of a mealybug infestation. Take a spray bottle and fill it with rubbing alcohol. Start by spraying on the affected areas of your succulent.&nbsp;

The mealybugs will turn brown and die once you spray on them. You will need to do this every week. You can use a mixture of neem oil and dish soap to get rid of mealybugs as well. You will need to spray this mixture thoroughly over your succulent.

## 2. Aphids

Aphids, commonly known as greenfly or blackfly, are small bugs that are attracted to plant sap. These bugs often cause the most damage to plants since they weaken the stem system by sucking out all the sap. They can even transfer viruses between plant species.&nbsp;

These pests produce a sticky residue called honeydew. If honeydew is left to buildup on a succulent, it can cause fungal infections. Leaves with heavy infestations can turn yellow. The best way to spot these bugs is to find sooty mold on your succulent.&nbsp;

The main problem with aphids is how fast they multiply. As a result, you might find a large number of aphids feeding on one plant at a time. These pests are colonizers and can even produce winged types when the plant has weakened enough.&nbsp;

## How to Get Rid of Aphids

Believe it or not you can get rid of small colonies of aphids simply by pruning or crushing the small pests. Use rubbing alcohol for larger colonies. Spray on the aphids and make sure each aphid gets hit by the spray droplets.&nbsp;

You will need to test a small spot of your succulent before rushing to spray rubbing alcohol or dish soap. Once you have sprayed, wash the plant thoroughly under the tap.&nbsp;

If you spot aphids on a succulent you had placed outdoors, consider changing the spot.&nbsp;

## 3. Spider Mites

Spider mites are small pests that live on the underside of leaves. These bugs can inflict damage by sucking chlorophyll from plants. They can disturb plant life cycles by inhibiting the process of photosynthesis. Plants can no longer produce food for themselves when this happens and can become weak.&nbsp;

The first way to spot a spider mite infestation is to look for small white spots on the leaves. When you'll look closer, you'll see small webs. These bugs can cause plant leaves to fall off or turn yellow.&nbsp;

The plant can even die if the infestation is left untreated.&nbsp;

## How to Get Rid of Spider Mites

The first way to get rid of spider mites includes pruning the leaves. You might need to throw away the affected part of your succulent's leaf or stem. In extreme cases of infestation, you might have to throw away the whole plant as well.&nbsp;

Exposing your succulent to water running at high pressure is also an effective method. Make sure to wash the underside of your succulent's leaves as well.&nbsp;

You can use neem oil to get rid of spider mites. Spider mites cannot stand the strong smell of neem oil. You can prepare a solution of neem oil and soap to spray it on the affected areas of your succulent.
