## Introduction

A cactus is best known for its remarkably straight and upright appearance. However, a cactus can fall over or begin drooping for a number of reasons. Keep reading to find out more!

**A cactus can droop or fall over due to weakened roots and underwatering. Watering once a week and moving your cactus into a bigger pot can help your cactus go back to normal.**

## Dehydration

Although a cactus does not require much water, it does need to be watered once a week during the hottest days of the summer. Dehydration can cause a cactus to become soft and mushy.&nbsp;

You will need to check the top layer of your soil before rushing to water your cactus. If the soil has completely dried out, only then water your cactus.&nbsp;

## Bugs

Another much less known reason behind a drooping or falling over cactus is a pest infestation. Pests such as mealybugs can suck out all the juice out of the stems of a healthy cactus and cause it to droop.&nbsp;

Mealybugs are scale insects that are attracted to moisture. They are attracted to the thick stem of a cactus and can cause irreversible damage to your plant.&nbsp;

Mealybugs can even attract ants by leaving honeydew over your cactus. This is a sugary substance that attracts other insects. If honeydew is left on the surface of the cactus, it can produce sooty mold which is even more harmful.

## Frost

Cacti cannot tolerate frost for even a few hours if the temperatures drop too low. Frost can cause irreversible damage to a cactus. It can cause a cactus to fall over within a few hours.&nbsp;

Freezing temperatures can slow down or stop the processes that take place inside a plant. These chemical processes often require an optimal temperature at which to work. Cacti enter their dormant phase during the winter.

During this phase, most plant activity slows down or stops entirely. Freezing temperatures pose another risk to plants. Ice often expands. If this occurs inside plant tissues, they can burst open.&nbsp;

## Insufficient Light

A cactus cannot function properly without getting enough sunlight. These plants thrive under indirect bright sunlight. Your cactus can start drooping or falling over if its light requirements are not being met.&nbsp;

A cactus needs between 10 to 14 hours of sunlight a day. Cacti need more hours of sunlight during the summer. However, don't overdo it! Cacti can get sunburnt too just like humans if they are exposed to bright sunlight for prolonged hours.&nbsp;

## Tips to Save your Cactus

Now that we've discussed the reasons why a cactus can droop or fall over, let us look at a number of solutions to those problems!

## 1. Repotting&nbsp;

{% include image.html image="repotting.jpg" alt="An image of a cactus with books" attributions="@bialons on Unsplash" %}

If your cactus has been affected by dehydration or underwatering, it might help to move it into a bigger pot. Doing so will make sure there's enough room for the roots of your plant.&nbsp;

You should repot your cactus especially when the roots have outgrown the drainage hole. Fast-growing cacti need to be repotted once every 2 to 3 years.&nbsp;

## 2. Rehydration

If your cactus showed signs of dehydration, don't waste any more time and water it immediately. Wait for the soil to be completely dry before you water it again.

## 3. Use Insecticidal Soap

{% include image.html image="insecticidal-soap.jpg" alt="An image of cacti in low lighting" attributions="@jesusance on Unsplash" %}

If your cactus has fallen victim to a pest infestation such as mealybugs, get an insecticidal soap from a local store. Washing your cactus before applying the insecticide is advised.&nbsp;

{% include warning.html title="PRO-TIP" subtitle="Wait for a day and wash the soap off with water" content="" %}

When using an insecticide on your plant, do not expose your cactus to direct sunlight. Exposure to direct sunlight can cause severe damage to your cactus.&nbsp;

## 4. Protect from Frost by Watering Less

If the temperatures have started to drop, the first thing you should do is water your plant less frequently. Doing so will protect your cactus from developing ice inside the plant cells.&nbsp;

You can use a cloth to cover larger cacti during the winter. This will provide enough protection from the freezing temperatures of winter.&nbsp;

## 5. Provide Enough Sunlight

A cactus requires plenty of sunlight daily to thrive. You should find a warm sunny spot inside your house for your cactus during the winter. You might even need to get artificial lighting.

Light is an important factor that can affect the health of your cactus.&nbsp;
