## Do Succulents like to be Crowded?

The effects that succulents can have on each other when they're too close depend on the seasons.&nbsp;

## Summer

You might be tempted to put your succulents close together in a pot. However, doing so can have an impact on their growing phase. Succulents that grow in groups often don't reach their full size.&nbsp;

Another thing to watch out for is tangled roots. The roots of succulents that grow together can get tangled with each other. This can cause many health problems for your succulents.&nbsp;

You will need to water your succulents at least once a week during the summer. Make sure to keep your plants hydrated to enhance the aesthetic appeal of your succulent arrangement. Water your succulents in the morning once a week during the summer.&nbsp;

## Fall

During the fall, most succulents enter their&nbsp;resting phase which is also called the dormant phase. You can use this to your advantage and group your succulents together.&nbsp;

Succulents often stop growing during this time. You won't have to worry too much about fulfilling the needs of your plant as well. You can use this time to plan unique succulent arrangements for holidays such as Halloween.&nbsp;

Succulents look great with pumpkin decor. The trick is simple. All you need to do is grab a knife and get to carving the top of a pumpkin. Place your succulents on top. Your succulents will be the centerpiece of this decoration.&nbsp;

## Winter

You will need to bring your succulents inside before the temperatures drop too low. Most succulents cannot tolerate frost and entire succulent arrangements can be ruined. Place your succulents in a sunny spot inside your house during the winter.&nbsp;

Your succulent arrangement will not need to be watered as frequently during the winter. Succulents are best known for their water-retaining ability. Freezing temperatures can cause death in some cases if proper care is not given.&nbsp;

Don't forget to prune your arrangement. Pruning helps maintain a neat and organized look for a succulent arrangement. So go on and grab your pruning scissors and get to work!
