## Soil

The right type of soil can have a great impact on the health of your plant. Choose wisely when it comes to soil mix. A well-draining soil mix is usually the best for Neon pothos.&nbsp;

This plant prefers a soil pH in the range 6.1 to 6.5. Make sure not to add any fertilizer which could change the soil pH. A slight change in the soil pH can produce unwanted results.&nbsp;

Perlite makes a great ingredient when making your very own soil mix. This substance occurs naturally and can be found at your local nursery as well. It provides great drainage if it is added to a soil mix.&nbsp;

Applying fertilizer to any plant can be quite tricky. The thing is, some plants don't do well when it comes to chemicals. If you still want to feed your plant, look for a diluted option.&nbsp;

A diluted fertilizer will provide all the essential nutrients to your plant that it needs without causing any harm. The concentrated salts present in a normal fertilizer will not have any adverse effects on your plant after dilution.
