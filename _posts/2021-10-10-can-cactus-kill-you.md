The Prickly pear cactus should be kept away from pets at all times. This cactus has small barbed glochids that can easily get stuck to the skin and animal fur. Getting pricked by them can cause severe pain.

What's worse is that these glochids are difficult to remove too. Tweezers often don't work if there's a large number of glochids stuck to the skin. If your pet has a large number of glochids attached to its fur or skin, take it to the vet immediately. Do not waste any more time!
