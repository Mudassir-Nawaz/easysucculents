#### Pokeberries

{% include image.html image="stock-photo-close-raceme-phytolacca-acinosa-purple.jpg" alt="undefined" attributions="undefined" %}

Pokeberry is the fruit of the pokeweed plant. Pokeweed, along with its berries, is poisonous to human beings. Despite its poisonous nature, this plant is still a part of Native American cuisine. In spring and early summer, shoots and leaves of the pokeweed plant become edible with proper cooking and are used in salads. 

In addition to this, the berries have been used in folk medicine for ages. Native Americans use pokeweed for achy muscles and joints (rheumatism), swelling of the nose, throat, and chest, swollen and tender breasts (mastitis), skin infections, and many other conditions. However, modern science fails to prove any effective medicinal usage of the pokeweed plant or its berries. Not all blueberries should be ingested, and pokeberries are one of them!
